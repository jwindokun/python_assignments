their men, including Officer Jack Traven Keanu Reeves and Detective Harry Temple Jeff Daniels Capt McMahon Joe Morton briefs the men on the situation bombs have already knocked out the main cables The only thing keeping the elevator from dropping to the basement is the emergency brake The bomber has wired this with explosives, and has given a one hour ultimatum pay him 37 million, or he blows the emergency brakeBoth Jack and Harry use building access panels to examine the bomb, before Jack comes up with the idea to use a window cleaner's crane on the roof as a way to hopefully help get the passengers off However, once they have hooked the crane, the bomber blows the emergency brakes, and the elevator begins to plummetThe crane cable stops the elevator for a short time between two floors, where Harry and Jack manage to get the passengers unloaded before the crane pulls free of it's base and the elevator plummets to the bottom Harry notes that the explosion happened earlier than the time limit given, with Jack thinking the bomber must still be in the building With the main elevators having been shut off, Jack assumes the bomber must be aboard a freight elevator in the buildingHarry and Jack find the freight elevator, where they encounter Howard Payne Dennis Hopper, their bomber, although his name is not yet known at this point Payne takes Harry hostage, and shows that he has wired himself with explosives Payne attempts to take Harry with him to the building's parking garage, but Jack shoots Harry in the leg, preventing Payne from taking Harry any further and causing Payne to drop him Payne makes a dash out the door, but before Jack can get to him, the explosives go off, knocking him backSome time afterward, a commendation ceremony is held in which Jack and Harry are congratulated for their services They go to a bar where they and their colleagues celebrate their victory An inebriated Harry tells Jack to be more cautious in his work because his recklessness could get him killedThe next day, Jack stops into a small coffee shop for a drink As he goes out to his car, a bus that had pulled away explodes and bursts into flames A payphone nearby rings, and Jack is surprised to hear Payne's voice on the line Payne explains that he had spent 2 years planning the 'elevator job,' and chastises Jack for ruining his 'life's work' The bomber then goes on to explain that he has planted another bomb on a bus, which will be armed the moment the bus passes 50 mph, and then will detonate if the bus drops below that speed Payne also explains that if any passengers are removed from the bus, he will detonate it himself, and asks for a ransom of 37 million the same amount he'd demanded during the elevator kidnapping by 11am Payne gives the bus number as 2525, and Jack takes off to catch up to itJack manages to catch up to the bus en route, but when he frantically tries to get the bus driver to open the doors, the driver ignores him, thinking it's a prank Jack then commandeers a Jaguar, and again catches up to the bus After a mad struggle, Jack manages to relay to the driver that there is a bomb on the bus, and manages to board, jumping from the moving car into the bus' door Harry is also alerted by Jack through the Jaguar owner's cellular phoneJack attempts to calm the bus passengers, but an altercation with one man wielding a gun causes an incident to break out, and the bus driver is wounded A young woman named Annie Porter Sandra Bullock takes the wheel, planning to hit the brakes, and it is then that Jack explains about the bomb on the bus to the passengers Jack opens an access panel in the bus floor, and finds the bomb Relaying this to Harry, Harry is perplexed that the timer for the bomb is attached to a cheap gold watch Harry's suspicions turn to the prospect that their mad bomber may be a former officer, and he has"

is saved by cowboy doll Woody voice Tom Hanks playing the sheriff, with help from Rex the dinosaur voice Wallace Shawn Woody is the only toy who gets to say his own lines because he has a pull-string

mother voice Laurie Metcalf decorating the dining room for his birthday party He asks if they can leave the decorations up until they move, and his mom agrees She says the guests will arrive soon and sends him back upstairs to get his baby sister Molly voice Hannah Unkrich, whose crib is in his room Andy tosses Woody onto his bed before he pulls Molly out of her crib and carries her awayWoody and

match between the two, the pilots are assigned to a top secret exercise on a B-3 Stealth Bomber a fictional advanced version of the actual B-2 Spirit stealth bomber with two B-83 nuclear bombs on board Deakins and Hale take off from Whiteman Air Force Base carrying the two live nuclear weapons on an evening exercise over UtahAfter successfully evading Air Force radar during the exercise, Deakins begins a friendly conversation to distract and shoot Hale A struggle ensues, ending when Deakins ejects Hale He then releases the bombs from the plane without detonating them When the Air Force base regains radar contact with the aircraft, Deakins reports, Hale's lost it I'm punching out, and ejects, leaving the plane to crash on the mountainside over the Utah canyonsA search and rescue team is sent to recover the warheads They do not find the warheads in the plane's payload bay remains and report a Broken Arrow, a situation wherein nuclear weapons are missing The team later locates the warheads in a canyon but are killed while recovering them by mercenaries, including Sgt Kelly Howie Long, a corrupt member of the team Deakins arrives moments later and plots his next move with Pritchett Bob Gunton, the operation's financierMeanwhile, Hale survives the ejection and is found by Park Ranger Terry Carmichael Samantha Mathis whom, after a brief stand-off, he convinces to help him track down Deakins and foil his plot After recovering the weapons from a hijacked Humvee and escaping to a nearby copper mine, Hale attempts to disable them using a safety feature which would render them unusable, by intentionally entering the arming code incorrectly Deakins, however, had anticipated this scenario, and Hale inadvertently arms the warheadFinding himself unable to disarm the warhead, Hale decides to place the unarmed weapon deep in the abandoned mine to prevent them from being used elsewhere Deakins arrives and secures the unarmed warhead, leaving Hale and Terry to die in the upcoming explosion A helicopter chases Deakins, as the mercenaries proceed with their mission to blackmail the government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a civilian area Pritchett berates him for allowing the helicopter to give chase, and Deakins, fed up with his complaining, kills Pritchett by crushing his throat with a flashlight Hale and Terry escape from the mine via an underground river just before the bomb detonates The bomb's EMP disables and subsequently destroys the NEST Team sent in to recover the warheads Terry and Hale track Deakins to a motorboat to be used for transporting the remaining warhead While trying to steal the boat, Terry is forced to hide on board while Deakins moves the warhead Military forces rescue HaleHale deduces that Deakins intends to move the warhead on board a train and sets off in a helicopter to find the train and hunt down the remaining mercenaries Aboard the train, Hale finds Terry, whom Deakins has tried, unsuccessfully, to threaten into arming the weapon A gunfight ensues in which the helicopter that Hale was on with Colonel Wilkins Delroy Lindo is destroyed, and Wilkins and most of Deakins' mercenaries are killed With his own helicopter sabotaged by Hale and his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to detonate the nuke early Kelly, realizing they will have no chance to get away in time, holds Deakins at gunpoint and demands he disarm the weapon As the train passes over a viaduct, Hale leaps into the boxcar and kicks Kelly out to his death below Terry detaches the rear section of the train with the bomb from the front, but soon gets into a shootout with the engineer, resulting in the engineer falling on the train brakes and causing the train to stop However, the detached boxcars continue to coast at high

going to Vegas She tells him her name is Nomi Malone Elizabeth Berkley and that she's going to Vegas to dance When the man tries to hit on her, Nomi pulls out a switchblade After the man freaks out and almost causes a collision with a tractor trailer, Nomi agrees to put the knife away Once they get to Las Vegas, the man takes Nomi to a casino under the pretense of getting her a job he convinces Nomi to leave her suitcase inside the truck Inside the casino, he leaves her with ten dollars at a slot machine, then disappears by the time Nomi realizes what has happened, she returns to the parking lot to find his truck gone, the man having abandoned her and stolen her suitcase As Nomi is crying and banging her fists on the side of a nearby car, the car's owner, Molly Gina Ravera, a seamstress, confronts her The impulsive Nomi dashes out into traffic, but Molly pulls her back just in time After talking and discovering Nomi does not have any family or place to go, Molly takes her into her trailer park homeTwo months later Nomi gets a job as a stripper at the sleazy Cheetah's Topless Club which is managed and run by the sleazy Al Torres Robert Davi who also appears as the club's MC Nomi considers herself a dancer, and she apparently sees that the Cheetah is a place where she can do this and still make a living While out dancing for fun at a nightclub called The Crave Club, Nomi meets a bouncer named James Smith Glenn Plummer James admires her dancing and Nomi is flattered until he dares to criticize what she's doing In retaliation, Nomi kicks him between the legs and he falls into another patron, sparking a brawl Nomi delights in what she's done, smiling to herself as all the men begin to throw punches, until someone recognizes her as the instigator and she's taken to jail

Molly works as the costume seamstress Since it is Nomi's dream to be a showgirl, she is thrilled to watch the show and see the backstage area Molly introduces her to Cristal Connors Gina Gershon, the diva-like star of the show Molly tells Cristal that Nomi is a dancer as well, but when Nomi tells her she dances at the Cheetah, Cristal derisively tells Nomi that what she does is akin to prostitution Nomi becomes furious, and her reaction intrigues Cristal, who is bisexual and apparently attracted to NomiThe next evening, Cristal and her cocaine-snorting boyfriend Zach Carey Kyle MacLachlan, the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit the Cheetah and pay Nomi 500 for a lap dance Nomi does not want to do the private dance, for fear it will prove her to be the prostitute

established an elaborate underground civilization because the earth's surface is considered uninhabitable by humans From time to time prisoners volunteer to don protective gear and gather specimens of insects from the surface to test for the presence of the virusOne such prisoner is James Cole, who after retrieving samples is given the chance to go back in time to 1996 and find information about the group believed responsible, known as The Army of 12 Monkeys Throughout the ensuing episodes, Cole finds himself remembering, as if in dreams, various things that he witnessed as a child, including the killing of a man in an airport This persists as a theme throughout the filmMiscalculation sends Cole to 1990, and he finds himself incarcerated in an insane asylum His psychiatrist, Kathryn Railly, thinks she has met him before, but his ravings are incoherent to her Eventually Cole is sent to an insane asylum where he is locked up with other lunatics There he meets Jeffrey Goines, who is definitely off the wall, but who tries to help him escape, handing him a key to the day room Cole is quickly recaptured and restrained in an isolation room When Railly her boss, Dr Fletcher, enter the room to check on Cole, he has vanished, snatched back to his present time by the scientists who sent him there He is interrogated and given a second chance to complete his mission A second miscalculation sends him to the battlefields of World War I, where he is wounded in the leg As he crawls around naked and in pain from his wound, he is suddenly propelled into the futureArriving in

of human lifeThey travel to Philadelphia, eventually finding a shabby storefront, the headquarters of Jeffrey Goines' Army of the 12 Monkeys The organization claims they've severed their ties with Jeffrey because he'd become too unpredictable and radicalBy this time, Dr Railly has become convinced that somehow Cole knows something--his predictions of the outcome of minor events is too uncanny The discovery of a World War I bullet in Cole's leg forces her to check a photograph from her own research, taken on the battlefield which, impossibly, shows Cole in the trenches She becomes convinced that The Army of 12 Monkeys indeed poses a threat, and she persuades Cole to take up his cause againThey travel to Jeffrey's father's mansion where Cole ties her up and leaves her in the woods In the middle of a fundraising dinner, Cole meets with Jeffrey Jeffrey rambles about how Cole had given him the idea to release a virus that would destroy most of humanity Cole leaves, chased by security

now convinced himself that he is delusional and wants Railly to help him Inside the storefront, Jeffrey is rambling about how Railly found him, that she must have processed his thoughts through a

compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers This leads to him not fitting in well with the children Their ruthless leader, Mara Lindsey Haun daughter of a local doctor, Dr Alan Chaffee Christopher Reeve her mother, Barbara Karen Kahn, commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff, considers him less important due to his expression of emotions Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not pain He and his mother Linda Kozlowski the local school principal share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word empathy, with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well When the other children experience pain, they simply use their powers to inflict the same pain on the adult responsible for the pain, for example forcing one of the mothers to put one of her arms in a pot full of boiling water, or forcing the local optometrist making herself blind with a painful liquidSoon, the other colonies of psychic children in foreign countries are eliminated because of their danger The scientific team at Midwich quickly flees the town to escape the chaos However, the lead government scientist, Dr Susan Verner Kirstie Alley, is killed by the children after being forced to show them David's partner, the baby that was stillborn Susan has secretly kept it so that she could perform an autopsy on it and study it A mob of angry townspeople attempt to stop the children, but the latter use their powers to kill the leader of the mob causing the other townspeople to flee quicklyThe State Police and the National Guards are then sent out to kill the children, who instead hypnotize them into shooting each other in a chaotic gun battleIn order to rid the town of the children, Alan devises a plan to detonate a briefcase of explosives inside the children's classroom By thinking of a brick wall, he is able to create a mental barrier and keep the presence of the bomb a secret from the children Jill begs him to save David because he is not like the others, and Alan agrees He attempts to do this by asking David to leave the classroom to get his books from his car Finally, Jill shows up, but the children stop her David, angered by this, rushes to her defense and knocks Mara over The children turn on David, but Jill rushes him from the building At last, the children break through Alan's defenses, but the explosives detonate, destroying the barn and killing everyone, including AlanJill and David survive the massacre she says that they would both move to a place where nobody knows them The last scene is of David, riding in his mother's car, looking off into the distance"

Kenton Emma Thompson, who worked with him as housekeeper during the years prior to the Second World War Twenty years later, Lord Darlington James Fox has died and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired American Congressman, Mr Lewis Christopher Reeve Kenton reveals that her marriage has failed and that she is nostalgic for the days when she worked at the house Stevens now one of the few remaining servants from the Darlington era goes to visit Miss Kenton, ostensibly to persuade her to return to serviceThe film flashes back to Kenton's arrival as housekeeper At the time, Darlington Hall was frequented by many politicians of the interwar period, men who decided important affairs of state while there Stevens, loyal and perfectionistic, calm and efficient, had to manage the household so that the servants seemed almost invisible, and he took great pride in his skills and his profession He clashed with Miss Kenton, his equal in the household hierarchy, but displayed only understated irritation with her and others Indeed, his utter focus and emotional repression were most fully displayed when his own father, also an employee, was dying Stevens continued his duties without pauseMiss Kenton was equally efficient and strong-willed but warmer and less repressed Relations between the two eventually warmed and Kenton even teased Stevens It becomes clear that she had fallen in love with him, and perhaps he with her, though his feelings are left ambiguous She tried to break through the wall, but Stevens' coldness was too formidable Finally, she struck up a relationship with another man and married him, leaving the house just before the outbreak of World War II Before her departure, she insulted Stevens, clearly out of distress that he had never expressed any emotional interest in her, but he still refused to be moved When she cried in frustration, the only response he could muster was to call her attention to a domestic taskLord Darlington used his influence to broker the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany He irritated Congressman Lewis, one of the dignitaries at a conference, who argued in favour of the foreign policy being conducted by professionals rather than by gentlemen amateurs After reading the work of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Lord Darlington commanded that two German-Jewish maids should be dismissed, considering their employment inappropriate Stevens carried out the order but Miss Kenton almost resigned in protest, fearing that the girls would have to return to Germany her own need for employment caused her to avoid following through Darlington later regretted his decision and asked Stevens to reinstate the maids, but they could not be locatedDarlington died a broken man, his reputation destroyed after he had been denounced a traitor in the Daily Mail When asked about his former employer, Stevens at first denies having served or even met him but later admits to having served him He recognises his former master's failings and indicates that he has regrets about his own life, as does Miss Kenton now Mrs Benn However, Kenton declines Stevens' offer to return to Darlington Hall, announcing instead that she wants to remain with her husband, since their daughter is soon to present them with a grandchild After the meeting, Stevens departs for Darlington Hall in a downpour of rain Kenton cries, while Stevens, still unable to demonstrate any feeling, simply raises his hatThe film's final scene shows Stevens making the final preparations to Darlington Hall in preparation for the arrival of Congressman Lewis' family As the two men enter the banquet hall, where a table tennis table now lies, Congressman Lewis reflects on the banquet that he attended in this room in 1935 and admits embarrassment over his comments He asks Stevens if he remembers the comments, to which Stevens replies that he was too busy serving Symbo"

and his wife Mallory go to a roadside caf in the New Mexico desert They appear to be normal customers, with Mickey eating key lime pie and Mallory dancing to rock 'n' roll on the jukebox A group of rednecks arrive and one begins dancing and flirting with Mallory She encourages him for a moment, then attacks him without provocation by smashing his beer bottle as he drinks from it A fistfight ensues, with Mallory beating the man When the redneck's friend intervenes, Mickey cuts off one of the cowboy's fingers and stabs him with a large Bowie-style knife Mickey and Mallory then begin killing the diner's patrons, culminating in a morbid game of Eeny, meeny, miny, moe to decide who lives and who dies among the last 2 customers After executing their final victim, Mabel the waitress, the couple make sure the only survivor, a cook, remembers their names before they embrace and declare their undying love for each otherPart IMickey and Mallory are in a desert at night Mallory is reminiscing about when they first met A flashback shows Mickey as a butcher's deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her abusive father Rodney Dangerfield, her neglectful mother Edie McClurg, and her younger brother Kevin The flashback is portrayed as a 1950s-type sitcom with a canned laughter track, the audience laughing hardest when Mallory is subjected to lewd comments and hints of molestation by her fatherMickey instantly falls in love with Mallory They leave together, Mickey stealing Mallory's father's car Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for grand theft auto, but he subsequently escapes a horse work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallory's house The two kill her father by beating him with a jack handle and drowning him in a fish tank, then burn her mother alive in bed They spare her ten-year-old brother, Mallory telling him that he is free They leave to rapturous applause from the audienceMickey and Mallory get married on the side of a bridge, exchanging snake wedding bands, cutting their palms and mixing their blood They drive to a motel for the night After watching television, they begin to have sex until Mickey is distracted by a female hostage Furious with Mickey's notion that they have a threesome, Mallory drives to a nearby gas station where she flirts with the mechanic They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory is angered by his over-aggressive oral sex and shoots him to death Back at the motel, Mickey rapes the hostagePart IIThe pair continue their killing-spree which bears similarities to Bonnie and Clyde and the Starkweather-Fugate murders, ultimately claiming 48 victims along Route 666 in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah Pursuing them are two characters who see the murderers as a chance to acquire fame for themselvesThe first is a policeman, Detective Jack Scagnetti, who seems particularly fascinated by Mallory Scagnetti is already a well-known personality, a published author, whose book Scagnetti on Scagnetti is a best-seller within law enforcement Scagnetti has a lifelong obsession with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman in Austin, Texas when he was eight Despite his heroic facade, he is actually sociopathic, strangling a prostitute to death in a hotel room after he tries to get too rough with her she scratches his faceThe second follower of the killers is journalist Wayne Gale He is an Australian who hosts a show called American Maniacs, which profiles mass murderers Various clips of Mickey and Mallory are shown, with Gale acting outraged on-screen as he details the pair's crimes, although off-air he clearly regards their crimes as a fantastic way of increasing his show's ratings It is Gale who is primarily responsible for elevating Mickey and Mallory to hero status, with his show featuring interviews with people around the world expressing their admiration for the killersMickey and Mallory become lost in the desert and

a large container, the creature within unseen During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workersThe story jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen We also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island, according to Donald Gennaro, an InGen representative, and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the parkAt a paleontological excavation in Montana we are introduced to Dr Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a Velociraptor, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill Part of Grant's research experiments with a new radiological device that shoots a probe into the dirt which bounces an image of an uncovered raptor skeleton back to a computer screen Grant is hesitant about the new technology but seems fascinated with the image it produces without having to dig He is also a follower of a long-held theory among paleontologists that dinosaurs evolved more from birds than reptilesThe dig is cut short by the sudden appearance of Grant and Sattler's main sponsor, the elderly and eccentric billionaire, John Hammond He invites them over to endorse his latest project, a remote island resort, where he claims that their unique biological attractions are guaranteed to drive children out their mindsGrant and Sattler are accompanied by two other characters -- the equally eccentric chaos theorist Dr Ian Malcolm, and the lawyer, Donald Genarro, who represents Hammond's investors As they arrive by helicopter, they are treated to a unique spectacle of living, breathing DINOSAURS, creatures beyond your wildest imagination, resurrected from the dead and roaming a special zoological environment built to sustain them Just the sight of these mighty beasts, a towering Brachiosaurus accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus, is enough to leave the stunned visitors breathless, save for Gennaro's offhand comment we're gonna make a fortune off this placea fortuneLater, as they arrive at the island's central resort and control facility, the visitors are given a brief tour of the process InGen has succeeded in cloning animals from simple strands of DNA salvaged from mosquitoes that fed on dinosaur blood, and were preserved for millions of years inside fossilized amber The group is shown the egg-incubation room, just in time to witness the birth of a baby Velociraptor, a sight that deeply disturbs Grant He demands to see where the adults are housedand we are shown the special containment facility seen in the introduction, a fortress of electrified fences and dense foliage, all that separates the humans from the most dangerous creature on the island Grant is witness to the daily feeding of the animals a cow is lowered into the pit, only to be stripped clean within moments The visitors and the audience is spared the gruesome sight of the carnage by a thick covering of jungle foliageThe group prepares to experience the theme park's central attraction, in which visitors embark on a safari-like tour of the park, on special electrified Ford Explorers Grant, Sattler, Malcolm and Gennaro are accompanied by Hammond's two grand children Lex and her little brother Tim As the group heads off, Hammond settles into the main

Soon he yells, Cut Print that Gretchen Heather Langenkamp, her husband, Chase, and their son, Dylan, are wandering around the set of the new Nightmare on Elm Street moviePresently the claw, which was only a prop a minute ago, comes to life and starts maiming and killing the special effects crew Dylan is now gone, and as the claw advances to attack Chase, Heather screams waking up in her own bed in

show line-up, Robert Englund as himself tears through a screen dressed up as Freddy Krueger to surprise Heather, Heather is slightly disturbed by this Producer Bob Shaye asks Heather to visit his office at New Line Cinema, and explains that Wes Craven is working on a script for the new and final Nightmare film Heather is asked to reprise her role as main character Nancy, but decides against it with her own recent nightmares, disturbing phone calls, and disgruntlement over her son's change in behavior Bob explains that her husband Chase Porter is also working on the film and he is creating a scary new glove for Freddy, much to Heather's dismayWhen she gets home, her son has an episode during which he warns her in a voice not of his own, Never sleep again Worried, Heather asks Chase to come home, however Chase falls asleep at the wheel on the way and dies supposedly in a car crash When Heather goes to identify the body, it seems to her that there may have been more than meets the eye to the crash, as was made apparent by the claw-like marks on his chest Dylan, now also grief stricken, continues acting even more strangelyShe enlists Wes Craven's help for making sense of what's been happening Craven explains that he does not know much more than she does He dreams a scene or two each night and wakes up and writes them down Craven goes on to tell her that in the script he's been writing, pure evil can be temporarily defeated if its essence is effectively captured in a work of art that is able to allow evil to express itself Craven explains that the evil has taken the form of Freddy Krueger because it is a familiar one Freddy sees her as the gatekeeper who holds Freddy at bay, since Heather's character Nancy defeated Freddy in the first movie who in turn eliminated Nancy in the third, but still couldn't be released To Freddy it is Heather that gave the character of Nancy her fortitude Freddy is attacking her at her weakest points, trying to break her down before confronting her, prompting her to leave just as confused as when she arrivedAfter a short sleep in Dylan's room, Heather wakes to discover Dylan is gone, she goes downstairs and finds Dylan in another

shun and attempt to kill what they consider to be unnatural creatures Mariner Costner is captured by a floating village, in which dirt is more precious then gold, and orange trees are worth an arm and a legDuring his execution, locked in a cage, the settlement is attacked by 'smokers', the villains, saving Mariner Costner He makes a lucky escape, reluctantly saving Helen Jeanne Tripplehorn Mariner then proceeds to find a legendary piece of land Mt Everest, which is still dry and habitable by land-living humansDefeating the 'Smokers' on the way, Mariner, Helen, and Helen's adopted daughter manage to finally reach this paradiseA creature of the sea, Mariner finds himself unable to tolerate living on dry land, and sails off into the distanceAn undetermined amount of time in the future the polar ice caps have completely melted and the surface of the Earth is an endless ocean A narrator tells us that the survivors of the ancient deluge have adapted to a new worldOne such survivor, known only as The Mariner, lives on a large sailed boat, a tri-maran, and lives by recycling his own urine through a special filter He drags the ocean floor for artifacts to sell at atolls, man-made island habitats where most of the last humans live While scavenging under the ocean surface, someone boards the Mariner's boat and steals the fruit from his tiny lime tree The Mariner surfaces and sees the other pilot's boat He holds him at bay for a few minutes with a harpoon gun, telling the pilot he's seen the boat before but doesn't recognize the man The man says he took it fair from the owner when he found him dead The pilot tells the Mariner about an atoll where he can find suppliesJust then, the two pilots spot two jet skis Aboard both are Smokers, pirates who thrive on terrorizing the seagoing inhabitants of the Earth, smoke cigarettes and use refined oil for fuel When they spot the pouch of recovered items the Mariner found on the ocean floor, they race for it As they do, the other pilot shows the Mariner that he stole his limes The Mariner throws several switches on his boat, raising a giant sail, giving his boat great speed He recovers his bag of goods, then steers his vessel toward the pilot who ripped him off He breaks the man's mast, leaving him helpless against the Smokers, who cease their chase of the Mariner when they catch up with the other pilot The Mariner

dirt, the world's most precious substance Inside the gates, he finds that the people live in poverty and are near starvation One small group is conducting a funeral where the deceased is recycled dropped into a pool of viscous waste The Mariner docks his boat is met by the atoll's security officer who tells him not to make any trouble that he has no more than two hours to conduct his business

they are about a day behind the thievesThe search party finally spots the thieves, camped out in a valley Knowing that an attack at night would be unwise, Rob orders his party to get some sleep He also says that he'll personally approach the thieves in the morning and try to negotiate with them When Alan asks Rob why he thinks speaking to them will accomplish anything, Rob tells him I know one of themThe next morning, Rob makes good on his word and wakes up the thieves in their camp He tells them that the cattle belong to his lord and they'll all live if they lay down their weapons and surrender the animals To prove his point, Rob tells his men to reveal their positions, which surround the camp Their leader, Sibbald, mocks Rob's authority When he tries to kill Rob, he is killed

with Killearn and signs the papers to receive the credit Rob leaves, charging his man MacDonald with collecting the credit slip Killearn deliberately makes MacDonald wait all day while he deals with all his other clients When Killearn finally calls MacDonald in to receive the loan, Killearn tells him that he cannot give him a credit slip and MacDonald must take coins instead, violating the agreement with Rob MacDonald is reluctant but finally accepts the coin On his way to deliver the money to Rob, he is pursued through the woods by Archie, who has prepared an ambush MacDonald's horse

doesn't show up, Rob goes back to Killearn, demanding to know what happened Killearn tells him that he'd given MacDonald the money and he left Killearn also suggests that MacDonald had stolen the money for himself and may have boarded a ship to America MacDonald had earlier told Rob he wished to leave Scotland for Virginia Rob refuses to believe that MacDonald would betray him and decides to

commercial which gives background information on how Tom became a self-made multi-millionaire airline entrepreneur Interspersed with the scene is another scene of people preparing what appears to be a kidnappers lair designed to hold a hostageThe next scene shows Tom with his wife Kate Rene Russo and his son Sean Brawley Nolte in central park attending a science fair that Kate is a judge of During this scene Tom's son Sean wanders away and although not shown, he is snatched and put in a white van Tom and Kate quickly realize their son is missing and frantically begin to search for himThe next scene has them at their apartment, receiving a phone call telling them to check their e-mail Their e-mail has a message with a video attachment of their son, blindfolded and chained to a bed in the kidnappers lair we previously saw being made ready A digitally-altered voice demands a ransom of 2 million for Sean's return The kidnapper also states that noone is to be told of this Police, FBI, or Media outletsEven though the message said not to, Tom and Kate decide that someone must be alerted They call up the FBI who quickly set up operations at the apartment, led by Agent Lonnie Hawkins Delroy Lindo Hawkins asks if Tom and Kate want to negotiate or give in to the ransom demands, and finds that the two already have two suitcases all prepared for a hand-off, awaiting further instructions from the kidnappersThe scene then cuts to a small convenience store, where we see NYC Police Detective Jimmy Shaker Gary Sinise conducting an investigation As he continues listening, he notices a suspicious character Donnie Wahlberg coming into the store buying kid's cereal and some video tapesThe next scene shows Jimmy tailing the man to the kidnapper's hideout Sneaking in, we see him find the locked room with Sean inside, and then see him go over to the man named Cubby, putting a gun to his head However, instead of arresting the man, Shaker tells him that his purchase could have tipped the Police off to their operation It is now clear to the audience that Jimmy is running the kidnapping of Sean MullenBack at Tom's penthouse, he confesses to Hawkins that a former union head of the machinist union may have had an involvement with the kidnapping of his son Tom confides that he bribed the union president to call off a strike and the president went to jail while Tom escaped prosecution Hawkins arranges a jailhouse meeting between Tom and the union leader in prison, but it is apparent from the meeting that the former union president had nothing to do with the kidnappingShortly thereafter, the kidnapper calls with instructions regarding the drop-off of the ransom money While on the phone, the FBI hit a major snag when they are unable to get a lock on the kidnapper's location due to technical scrambling on the kidnapper's part The FBI suggests that their 'double' for Tom make the drop, but Tom insists he do it himself He is also set up with a wire to record any conversationsTom reaches a specific street location, and his car's cellular phone then directs him to a gym Tom is then instructed to take the money with him, and dive into the gym's swimming pool to retrieve a locker-room key This move causes the wire on Tom to short-circuit, destroying the FBI's planted mechanism Tom then finds the locker, and a walkie-talkie, which instructs him to put on some clothes provided in the locker, and put the money in two large duffel bags before he heads to a parked car outside to drive to the drop-off point This leaves the suitcases in the gym, causing the FBI to question why the money hasn't movedTom drives on as afternoon becomes evening Over the walkie-talkie, the kidnapper derides Tom that he seems to have no problems with buying

officer to launch a retaliation strike against the Soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command, including the President, has been killed during a sneak attack Plan R was intended to discourage the Soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the President in Washington to disrupt US command and control and stop an American nuclear counterattack Turgidson tries to convince Muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Soviets as a threat by launching a full-scale attack Turgidson believes that the United States is in a superior strategic position, and a first strike against the Soviet Union would destroy 90 of their missiles before they could retaliate, resulting in a victory for the US with acceptable American casualties of no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops depending on the breaks He is rebuked when Muffley instead admits the Soviet Ambassador Peter Bull to the War Room, contacts Soviet Premier Dmitri Kissoff on the hotline, and insists on giving the Soviets all the information necessary to shoot down the American planes before they can carry out their strikesGroup Captain Lionel Mandrake also played by Peter Sellers, an RAF exchange officer serving as General Ripper's executive officer, realizes that there has been no attack on the US when he turns on a radio and hears pop music instead of Civil Defense alerts When Mandrake reveals this to Ripper, and Ripper refuses to recall the wing, Mandrake announces that he will issue the recall on his own authority, but only Ripper knows the three-letter code necessary for recalling the bombers and locks the two of them in his office Mandrake tries to convince Ripper to give up the three letter code The psychotic Ripper refuses and rambles on that the Communists have a plan to sap and impurify the precious bodily fluids of the American people with fluoridated water, a theory that occurred to him during sexual intercourse, and which he believed to be the cause of his post-coital fatigueOver the phone, an unseen and drunken Kissoff reveals to the Soviet Ambassador that their country has installed an active Doomsday Device which will automatically destroy all human and animal life on Earth if a nuclear attack were to hit the Soviet Union The Doomsday Device is operated by a network of computers and has been conceived as the ultimate deterrent as a safeguard, it cannot be deactivated, or it will set itself off, because its hardware and programs have been configured in such a way that an attempt at its deactivation would be recognized as sabotage The doomsday weapon is described as based on cobalt-thorium-G this was inspired by the real idea of a cobalt bomb, conceived by nuclear pioneer Leo Szilard, founder of Council for a Livable World According to the Soviet ambassador, life on Earth's surface will be extinct in ten months and was made as a low cost alternative to the bomb-raceThe President now calls upon Dr Strangelove aka Merkwrdigeliebe, a former Nazi and strategy expert Sellers in his third role The wheelchair-bound Strangelove is a type of mad scientist, whose eccentricities include a severe case of alien hand syndrome, so that his right hand, clad in an ominous black leather glove, occasionally attempts to strangle Strangelove or make the Nazi sa"

everything at Hudsucker Industries is going great Profits and the stock price have never been so high, so it is shocking when President Waring Hudsucker Charles Durning runs down the table at the Board of Directors meeting and throws himself out the 45th floor window of the Hudsucker building Despite this tragedy, vice-president Sidney J Mussburger Paul Newman quickly focuses the board on the problem that Waring's death has left them With no designated heir his 51 percent share of stock will be sold to the public one month from that day The board would like to buy the stock and retain control of the company, but at the current price, they cannot afford itMussburger comes up with a plan to depress the stock price by temporarly putting an obviously incompetent person in the President's seat But who can he find that is stupid enough to qualifyFortunately, for him, Norville Barnes Tim Robbins has just arrived in town with a brand new degree from the Muncie, Indiana, School of Business Barnes has an idea for a new product, which he shows to everybody he meets Unfortunately it appears to only be a circle drawn on a piece of paper as Barnes has a problem explaining exactly what he has in mindBarnes is working in the Hudsucker mailroom the morning of Waring's death and as the new boy is given the unenviable task of taking a high-priority Blue letter they are always bad news up to Mussburger's office Before delivering the letter Barnes first tries to show Mussburger his idea for his new product and in the process sets an important contract on fire and nearly causes Mussburger to fall out the window In all this, however, Mussburger realizes he had found the perfect dupe to take the president's jobWith a shave and a new wardrobe Barnes is quickly installed in the president's office, separated from Mussburger's own by the works of the massive company clock It is at this point we meet the kindly clock keeper Bill Cobbs and the company repairman They seem to represent good and evil forces in the filmNewspaper editor John Mahoney is suspicious of this move to put a novice at the helm of such a big company and dispatches prize-winning reporter Amy Archer Jennifer Jason Leigh to find out what is going on Approaching Barnes as a poor, unemployed girl from Muncie, Archer gets him to hire her as his secretary At first she thinks him an imbecile, and writes her story like this causing the stock price to plummet just as Mussburger wants She soon changes her mind, however, seeing him as a bright and good-hearted fellow who is just totally naive about company politics They soon start to fall in loveNow that he is the president, Barnes decides to have the company produce his new product Mussburger goes along with this as he expects it to be a bust further dropping the stock price As it turns out Barnes's idea, when actually manufactured, is the hula-hoop which soon becomes a big success and pushes Hudsucker stock prices to new heightsMussburger sets out to totally discredit Barnes by having elevator operator Buzz Jim True-Frost claim Barnes stole the hula-hoop idea from him He also discovers that Archer is actually the reporter that wrote the story bad-mouthing Barnes and accuses him of bad judgment in hiring her The apparent betrayal by Archer sends Barnes into an emotional tailspin and Mussbuger has psychiatrist Dr Hugo Bronfenbrenner David Byrd declare him mentally incompetentArcher finds Barnes at a beatnik bar on New Years Eve and tries to apologize to him, but he leaves intending to throw himself out the window of his office He first puts on the apron he wore in the mailroom and then climbs out on the ledge He finds he can't do it, but slips and falls anyway Suddenly halfway to the ground he stops as the clock keeper has wedged a broom handle into the mechanism of the company clock apparently stopping timeWhile Barnes hangs in space, Waring Hudsucker visits him in the form of an angel Waring

futuristic tech equipment, leaving them stranded and dead The mysterious highwayman steals the trunk containing the gold and then suddenly vaporizes into a gelatin like mistIn 1994, 131 years later, the US government creates the Time Enforcement Commission TEC to combat the misuse of newly developed time travel technology They have discovered that the same gold bullion was used in recent arms purchases The TEC is to detect time ripples among the timelines and to stop them from happening before they reach the present, since people cannot travel forward in time to the future, they always travel back to either change history or steal richesNote the mysterious highwayman who killed the Confederate soldiers to steal their gold is never revealed or identified Senator Aaron McComb Ron Silver volunteers to oversee the commissionMeanwhile, police officer Max Walker Jean Claude Van Damme is offered a job as a TEC agent He meets his wife Melissa Mia Sara at a local shopping mall where he stops a purse snatcher He notices three odd-looking punk men following them despite never seeing them before Walker and Melissa go home to their large fancy house and later make loveLater that same evening, Max is attacked in his home by the same intruders he saw earlier at the mall and Melissa is killed in an explosion, destroying his houseTen years later in the year 2004, Walker is now a veteran TEC Agent He is sent back to October 1929, in the midst of the Wall Street crash to arrest his former partner Atwood Jason Schombing for taking advantage of the US stock-market crash After subduing Atwood's bodyguards, Walker interrogates Atwood who reveals that he is working for Senator McComb, who needs money for his presidential campaign Terrified by McComb's threat to murder his ancestors, thereby wiping out his existence, Atwood tries to kill himself by jumping out a window Walker catches him as he falls and takes him back to 2004, but Atwood refuses to testify against McComb and the TEC agency sends him back to 1929, right where he left off, this time falling to his deathSenator McComb arrives at the TEC agency to oversee the work and to congratulate Walker for his recent successful mission Walker implies to McComb that he knows all about his dirty dealings behind the scenes in Washington and about his means to acquire money for his campaign McComb leaves the facility and orders his aide to have Walker killed The next morning, two assassins break into Walker's small apartment and attempt to kill him, but Walker, a trained martial arts expert, kills both assassins after a violent and protracted fightWhile still trying to investigate McComb to expose him of corruption, Walker is partnered with agent Sarah Fielding Gloria Reuben, and sent back to 1994 to investigate a pending ripple, where they find a young Senator McComb arguing with his business partner Jack Parker about their company's new computer chip Parker offers to buy McComb's share of the company, but suddenly, the older McComb arrives from 2004 to warn his younger self that the chip will make huge profits A fight starts when Walker is double-crossed by Fielding, who reveals she works for McComb McComb kills Parker, wounds Fielding, attempts to kill Walker, and manages to escape back to 2004When Walker returns to 2004, he finds that things have become worse McComb now owns the computer company, with no record of Parker He is almost guaranteed the Presidency with his finances and approval rating The TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts There is also no record of Fielding Realizing that he has to fix things, Walker hijacks the original prototype time machine which McComb had been using for their illegal trips with the help of Commander Matuzak Bruce McGill,

of his misadventures on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament Besides wanting to win the poker championship for the money, he also wants to prove, once and for all, that he is 'the best' However, complications keep getting in the wayMaverick rides into the fictional town of Crystal River intending to collect money owed to him, as he is 3000 short of the poker tournament entry fee of 25,000 His efforts to make up this 3000 provide some plot motivation, as well as diversions caused by, and in the company of, three people he encounters at Crystal River-an antagonist named Angel Alfred Molina, a young con-artist calling herself Mrs Annabelle Bransford Jodie Foster, and legendary lawman Marshal Zane Cooper James Garner, who played Bret Maverick in the original TV series The first two are also rival poker playersMaverick, Bransford and Cooper share a stagecoach the driver of which dies at the reins at full gallop, agree to help a wagon train of migrant evangelist settlers who have been waylaid by ruffians for a fee which Maverick in the end is too big-hearted to accept and are headed-off by a troop of Indians led by Joseph Graham Greene Unknown to his companions, Joseph and Maverick are good friends, and Maverick allows himself to be captured Joseph is another one of his unreliable debtors, and in and around his tribal grounds they collaborate on a scheme to swindle a Russian Grand DukeDuring this time, Angel has received a mysterious telegram ordering him to not allow Maverick to reach the poker game, and has also learned that Maverick had conned him in Crystal River These scenes are some of the very few which do not involve Maverick directly Angel catches up with Maverick after he has left Joseph's tribe, beats him up and attempts to hang him Despite being tied to both a tree and to his horse, Maverick escapes and reaches the poker game-on a paddle steamer-safely Bransford and Angel have also reached the game, and Cooper who is engaged to ensure the security of the gameAfter preliminary rounds, the four finalists are Maverick, Bransford, Angel, and the Commodore of the boat James Coburn Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 500am deadline, having had his stateroom door chained by an unknown person after a short tryst with Bransford The game proceeds, with Bransford the first eliminated, and shortly thereafter a fixed hand is dealt to the three remaining players The Commodore is given four 8s and Angel is given a low straight flush, whilst Maverick has the 10, Jack, Queen and King of Spades The Commodore and Angel each bet all in inferring that Maverick is the chip leader at this stage Maverick observes the dealer bottom-dealing to the others, protests the conduct of the hand, and eventually accepts one card dealt by Angel and calls the bets without checking the card It is, melodramatically, the Ace of Spades Note that a 9 of Spades would also have won the hand for Maverick An enraged Angel draws his gun but he, and his stooges in the audience, are gunned down in rapid succession by Cooper and Maverick drawing one of Cooper's gunsThree plot twists follow Maverick's win Firstly, Cooper steals the 500,000 prize money instead of presenting it to Maverick Secondly, it is revealed that the Commodore and Cooper were secretly in cahoots on the theft and that Angel had actually been working for the Commodore Thirdly, Maverick ambushes the two around a campfire and steals back the money He leaves them with a single gun to settle their affairs Cooper beats up the Commodore and angrily vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Maverick, even if it means hunting him to the ends of the earthLater, Maverick is relaxing in a bath-house when Cooper finds him, and drops the facade to reveal to the

Manchuria in Communist China After the war, the soldiers return to the United States, and Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw Laurence Harvey is credited with saving their lives in combat Upon the recommendation of the platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco Frank Sinatra, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for his supposed actions In addition, when asked to describe him, Marco and the other soldiers automatically respond, Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my lifeDeep down, however, they know that Shaw is a cold, sad, unsociable loner As Marco puts it It isn't as if Raymond is hard to like He's impossible to like Marco who has since been promoted to Major suffers from a recurring nightmare in which a hypnotized Shaw strangles one of his fellow soldiers, and shoots another, killing both before the assembled military brass of communist nations, during a practical demonstration of a brainwashing technique Raymond and his platoon have been hypnotized into believing that the Korean military brass are a bunch of harmless old American ladies from a garden club Marco wants to investigate, but receives no support from Army Intelligence as he has no proof However, Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon, Allen Melvin James Edwards, has had the same nightmare When Melvin and Marco separately identify some of the men in the dream as leading figures in communist governments, Army Intelligence decides that this is too much of a coincidence and agrees to help Marco investigateShaw's mother, Mrs Eleanor Iselin Angela Lansbury, is the driving force behind her husband, Shaw's step-father, Senator John Yerkes Iselin James Gregory, a bombastic demagogue in the style of Joseph McCarthy, who is dismissed by most people as a fool Shaw hates them both, especially his domineering mother Senator Iselin's political stature is established when per his wife's orders he interrupts a televised press conference given by the Secretary of Defense, accusing him of knowing that some 207 Defense Department employees are card carrying Communists This provokes the expected chaos and shock among journalists and an enraged reaction from the SecretaryHowever, unknown to everyone including Raymond, the Iselins are actually Communist agents with a plan intended to take them all the way to the White House His mother is actually the American operative for whom Raymond is to effect the operation's final step Raymond was conditioned in Manchuria to be an unwitting assassin whose actions are triggered by a Queen of Diamonds playing card When he sees it, he will obey the next suggestion or order given to him by anyone When given instructions to kill selected targets, he must also kill any witnesses and never remember his actions, making him the perfect assassin It is revealed that Shaw's heroic action was a false memory implanted in the platoon by the communists in Manchuria, and that they were covertly returned to the American lines when their conditioning was completed The actions for which Shaw was awarded his Medal of Honor never took placeRaymond briefly finds happiness when he rekindles a youthful romance with Jocelyn Jordan Leslie Parrish, the daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan John McGiver, one of his stepfather's political rivals Raymond had previously courted Jocelyn in order to get at his parents in a Romeo and Juliet-style romance, but they then genuinely fell in love, both she and her father being the nearest thing Raymond has ever had to having friends Mrs Iselin broke up the relationship for obvious political reasons, but now facilitates the couple's reunion as part of her scheme to garner the support of Senator Jordan for her husband's own sudden vice presidential bidJocelyn, wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume outfit, inadvertently hypnotizes Raymond at a costume party thrown by the Iselins and the couple elopes Altho"

Gordian Ron Silver at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but Phil dismisses the claims Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, KikiZane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin Richard Schiff, but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green Lindsay Crouse protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built, that appears to be the cause of this increase The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil, except that he is of Mexican ethnicity whereas Phil is not As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by a scorpion planted in her roomZane discovers the plant is a front for an underground alien base The very different looking aliens are able to disguise themselves with an external skin to infiltrate our society Zane finds that all of the bases expel large amounts of emissions into the atmosphere Zane is discovered but escapes back into the nearby town and attempts to convince the local sheriff of the situation However, alien agents bring Ilana's body to the police station, making Zane a suspect in her death Zane escapes and sneaks back into the United States He accosts Phil on the JPL grounds, forcing him to admit that the aliens are trying to raise the Earth's temperature to not only kill off humans but make the planet hospitable for themselves Zane secretly records the conversation and once Phil discovers the recording he sends agents to stop ZaneZane returns home to find his attic devoid of equipment He figures out the only way to broadcast the tape is to go to a nearby telescope and beam the signal directly to a television satellite, broadcasting it worldwide With the help of his girlfriend Char Teri Polo and Kiki, he travels to the telescope Phil and his agents soon disable the telescope controls from the main building Zane leaves the tape with Kiki and instructs him to transmit it when he gives the order and then he and Char sneak over to the telescope's base and barricade themselves in the control room Zane makes the necessary adjustments and tells Kiki to active the tape, but Kiki reveals himself to be an alien agent, and opens the door to allow Phil inside and confiscate the tape himselfPhil and his agents ram down the door to the telescope room with a van, but Zane freezes them with cryogenic gases As he works to free the tape stuck in Phil's frozen jacket, one of the agents drops a sphere which starts to form another singularity in the room Zane and Char escape through

accompanied by the eerie wailing of a Theremin The camera moves inside the house to reveal a coffin which opens and from the coffin Criswell sits up This is nearly identical to opening scene to Night of the Ghouls Criswell offers an opening commentary which practically repeats the opening commentary from Plan 9 from Outer Space Credits follow with most of the cast names displayed on tombstones again similar to Plan 9 The camera moves from the Hollywood sign and down into Hollywood itselfIt is a rainy night outside a dilapidated theater in Hollywood It is the early 1950s The eccentric and goof-ball theater director Edward D Wood Jr Johnny Depp is pacing outside, waiting for the press who have not shown to review his play The Casual Company, a World War II-esq military drama The show finally goes on to an almost empty house Later that night Ed, his close friend John Bunny Breckinridge Bill Murray and the three principal actors in the play, Dolores Fuller Sarah Jessica Parker, Paul Marco Max Casella and Conrad Connie Brooks Brent Hinkley read Victor Crowley's scathing review of the play, the only positive comment being about the realistic costumes Later that night Ed, who is living with Dolores, expresses his doubts about his achieving success in the film industry He worries that he's nearly thirty and Orson Welles, whom Ed idolizes, was 26-years old when he made Citizen Kane Dolores reassures him and then absent-mindedly makes a comment to herself about never being able to find her clothes Ed turns over in bed with a worried look on his faceA few days later, Ed is working in the props department at a film studio as his second job and he is asked to take a potted palm over to the executive offices Ed makes a bit of a side trip to see some new stock footage the studio received, and comments that he could probably make a complete movie using just the stock footage Later, in the office he overhears two office girls discussing an article in Variety about a bio-pic being considered about sex-change personality, Christine JorgensenEd phones George Weiss Mike Starr, head of Screen Classics, a small studio which specializes in soft-core sexploitation films, which was making the bio-pic Ed assures him that he is the most qualified man in Hollywood to direct the sex-change film Later Ed is talking to Weiss in his office who tells him that the Christine Jorgensen story is off Christine heard about it fromVariety, and was asking for too much Weiss was still planing a sex-change film though, to be called I Changed My Sex He has no script yet or director Ed tells him that he can direct and write the movie When Weiss asks him why he is the most qualified man in Hollywood to do this movie Ed tells him he himself is a cross-dresser and can add an extra note of realism to the movie Weiss tells Ed that he does not need someone who has a burning desire to tell his story Discouraged, Ed leavesOn his way home, Ed meets Bela Lugosi Martin Landau He is leaving a funeral home complaining about the uncomfortableness of the coffins The two start talking and begin a close friendship as Ed drives Bela home to his small house Ed learns that Bela has not worked in four years Later, Ed is discussing Bela with Weiss who calls Bela a washed-out junkie He suggests that if Ed thinks he is so great he should hire Bela himselfOn Halloween night 1953, and Ed and Bela are watching White Zombie at Bela's home on the TV The show breaks for a commercial, introduced by horror-show hostess Vampira Lisa Marie whom Bela refers to as a honey A short while later, Vampira makes a comment about the film starring Bela Lugosi and a bunch of other people I've never heard of This seems to depress Bela who goes into the back to take his medicine The medicine seems to work almost immediately and Bela is soon cheerfully scaring trick-or-treating children as DraculaUsing the promise of getting Bela to sta"

are on a cruise during their honeymoon heading for India They meet an extremely sensual young woman of French origin called Mimi Emmanuelle Seigner, extremeley flamboyant and Paris-cosmopolitan, and by means of her they come to meet American wanna-be author Oscar Peter Coyote, a disabled man in a wheelchair Oscar starts telling their love story to Nigel and Fiona The latter finds it gruesome and unsettling, and doesn't want to know how it ends, but Nigel will become completely obsessed with the love-hate story of Mimi and OscarOscar finds in Mimi, a student dancer, a willing partner for his almost hardcore sexual games, ever pushing their boundaries together She is completely enraptured by him, and bows to his every whim However, without any furthr reason that his caprice, he gets bored out of his wits about her He is rude and wicked to her, and tells her that he'd rather she left him for good Mimi packs her things, and is about to leave him forever She has opened the door to the condo where they have been living together, but re-enters the flat again She wants to stay no matter whatLife will be hell for Mimi from that moment on He becomes really abusive towards her, and she puts up with everything Their sexual antics become sadistic, full of anger and twisted mentality I agree with some other reviewers into saying that Mimi becames a mere shadow of her former self She has stayed with him, but life becomes a nightmare She mus quit all her life and interests in order to pursue her obsesive love for himShe has to do things she doesn't really want to because if not, Oscar will sent her packing for good, and she knows this time there won't be a second chance Finally, she becomes pregnant, and that's a door for her to lead a normal couple life with Oscar They agree to leave France together and keep the child However, Oscar's behaviour is selfish and rotten once more He pretends to follow-suit her, but when they are both on the plane to Martinique, he leaves the plane with some dumb excuse Mimi is completely distraught, and the audience will come to know what she did afterwards She had an abbortion performed by some doctor who butchered her, and had to surpass a terrible infection on her own The surgery and its consequences have left her uncapable of getting pregnant again, and that comes to a shock to her as wellMeanwhile, Oscar returns to his happy life he goes to parties, gets drunk, and has sexual relations with all sorts of women He doesn't seem to write much Once, he is so drunk that he suffers a car accident which will leave him crippled for life Mimi returns to Paris because, after all, her traumatic experiences have not made her to forget him She won't forgive him, but the audience will come to know how much she loves him in spite of it all She has become frustrated, angry, and wants revenge for everything Oscar has made he go through despite her love She takes care of him, but in a twisted and cruel way She doesn't allow him to talk to any of her former lovers, or go out of home without her One of the prevert things she did is to hold a long conversation leavin Oscar in the full-of-water bath While she's talking gayly, the water gets colder and colder, so Oscar has to leave the bathroom crawling like a worm Mimi sees this with a half-smile onto her lips, and keeps on chatting as though without a care in the world On another occassion, she gives him a present a gun with a single bullet so that he can commit suicideComing back to the crouse, Fiona gets utterly fed-up of Nigel She is afraid that he wants to have sex with Mimi, because she's constantly flirting with and giving hints to him She tells him that she can do anything better than him, so she starts flirting with Dado Luca Vellani during Oscar's

in the Cold War Soviet Union British secret agent James Bond Pierce Brosnan and his fellow 00 agent, Alec Trevelyan Sean Bean, have infiltrated a secret Soviet chemical weapons production facility with the intention of destroying it After finding their target, a large room filled with chemical canisters, James begins to plant explosive charges while Alec holds off the facility's guards Alec is captured by the ruthless General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov Gottfried John, who orders Bond to surrender Bond resets the charge timers from six minutes to three and walks out to surrender just as Ourumov seemingly executes Trevelyan with a bullet to the head Bond takes cover behind a cart of chemical canisters and moves toward a conveyor belt that leads outside A soldier with an itchy trigger finger is shot dead by Ourumov when he shoots at Bond Bond is able to escape on the conveyor belt and shoots out the locks holding hundreds of other canisters which temporarily bury Ourumov's men Outside the facility, Bond, using a motorcycle, leaps after a plane that falls off a nearby cliff He successfully regains control of the plane and flies off as the weapons plant explodesNine years later Bond is driving in the mountains near Monaco with a female psychiatrist from MI6 who is assigned to evaluate his mental state He races down a mountain road, just as another woman, Xenia Onatopp Famke Janssen, pulls up alongside him in a red Ferrari A somewhat dangerous driving game ensues between Bond and Xenia, which ends when Bond's psychiatrist demands that he halt the game Bond does and seduces herBonds current assignment is to observe possible subversive Russian involvement from the Janus crime syndicate in the demonstration of a French hi-tech helicopter called the Eurocopter

mistress of a Canadian Air Force captain That night, while on the guy's private yacht, she kills in the middle of having sex with him, by crushing his chest between her thighs, while an accomplice steals the admiral's ID The next morning, Bond searches the yacht and finds the body He rushes to the site of the Tiger demonstration As he arrives, Xenia and her accomplice kill the test pilots and

to hand over the activation keys and control disk for Goldeneye and promptly has Onatopp machine-gun everyone working at the facility to leave no witnesses while she's using the weapon, she shows

Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed insteadBernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie Don Calfa on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him When Larry and Richard arrive at the beach house, they find their boss's body Before they can call the police, however, guests arrive for a party that is a regular event at Bernie's house every weekend To Larry's and

Clancy Brown, savagely beats a newly arrived inmate because of his crying and hysterics The inmate later dies in the infirmary because the prison doctor had left for the night Meanwhile Andy remained steadfast and composed Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman, known as Red, bet against others that Andy would be the one to break down first and loses a considerable amount of cashAbout a month later, Andy approaches Red, who runs contraband inside the walls of Shawshank He asks Red to find him a rock hammer, an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting Though other prisoners consider Andy a really cold fish, Red sees something in Andy, and likes him from the start Red believes Andy intends to use the hammer to engineer his escape in the future but when the tool arrives and he sees how small it is, Red puts aside the thought that Andy could ever use it to dig his way out of prisonDuring the first two years of his incarceration, Andy works in the prison laundry He attracts attention from the Sisters, a group of prisoners who sexually assault other prisoners Though he persistently resists and fights them, Andy is beaten and raped on a regular basisRed

in the prison, agrees, providing the men with cold beer before the job is finished Red remarks that Andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the prison guards as much as with his fellow inmates, but Red also thinks Andy did it simply to feel freeWhile watching a movie, Andy demands Rita Hayworth from Red Soon after, Andy once more encounters the Sisters and is brutally beaten,

woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resistsLate in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter Troy Evans and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson Courtney Cox are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this pet detective in to try investigatingMeanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters Antoni Corone and Margo Peace awayLater that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters After an altercation with Sgt Aguado John Capodice, Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio Tone Loc to find out what leads the police may have Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible At this point, Emilio's superior, attractive female Lt Lois Einhorn Sean Young comes along and throws Ace outAce visits his hacker buddy Woodstock Raynor Scheine to try and find information relating to the purchase of equipment that would be necessary for handling a dolphin Woodstock notices several purchases by a man named Ron Camp Udo Kier, a billionaire who apparently enjoys gathering rare fish Furthermore, Woodstock notes that Camp donated land to the Miami Dolphins for the building of a new stadiumAce decides to investigate Ron Camp further and gets into a party thrown by Camp that evening with Melissa As Camp attempts to seduce Melissa, Ventura investigates Camp's home and finds a large aquarium tank that he assumes holds the missing Snowflake However, the tank actually holds a large shark and Ace barely escapes with his lifeAs Melissa and Ace leave the party, her very annoyed and him wet as a hen and with rags instead of pants, the detective notices an unusual ring on Camp's hand, manhandling the billionaire in order to get a closer look When they return to the stadium, Ace informs Melissa of the stone he found in Snowflake's tank-and Camp's ring had the same kind of stones, but since no stones were missing, Camp was not the one responsible for Snowflake's abduction The ring in question is a 1984 AFC Championship Ring, won by the Miami Dolphins Ace decides to personally investigate all the ring-owners to find one with a missing stone, but before long his photographic list of suspects has run out with no resultsMelissa attempts to console Ace about his failure to find the damaged ring Ace is in no mood for her and they trade insults As Ace goes inside to apologize, Melissa receives a devastating phone call- Roger Podacter is deadThe police investigate Podacter's apartment, learning that Roger's body was found after crashing through a sunroof twenty stories below his apartment balcony Lt Einhorn is in charge of the

Eamonn Roche, his landlady Mrs Peeman Nancy Fish, and car mechanics His only friends are his Fox Terrier Milo and his co-worker Charlie Richard Jeni Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell Peter Greene runs the exclusive Coco Bongo nightclub while plotting to overthrow his boss Niko Orestes Matacena Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle Cameron Diaz into Stanley's bank with a hidden camera, in preparation to rob the bank Stanley is smitten with Tina, and she seems to reciprocate Later that night after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he is stranded with a broken-down rental car at the city's filthy harbor, where he finds a mysterious wooden mask next to a pile of garbage which at first he mistakes to be a drowning man He takes the object home and jokingly puts it on The mask wraps around his head, transforming him into a wackily-suited, green-headed, figure, The Mask, a trickster with reality-bending powers, physical imperviousness and without personal inhibitions who exacts comical revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and scares a street gang that attempts to mug himThe next morning, Stanley encounters world-weary Edge City detective Lieutenant Kellaway Peter Riegert and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt Amy Yasbeck, both of whom are investigating the Mask's activities of the previous night Despite these threats, the temptation to again use the mask is overwhelming and he puts it back on that evening Needing money to attend Tina's performance at the Coco Bongo, the Mask noisily interrupts Tyrell's bank robbery and steals the targeted money while Tyrell's henchman Freeze Reginald E Cathey is shot by police responding to the disturbanceThe Mask buys entry into the Coco Bongo, where he rocks the joint by dancing exuberantly with Tina in front of the cheering crowd after Tyrell is called away by Sweet Eddy Denis Forest After Freeze dies in Tyrell's arms, Tyrell violently asks who was responsible and Eddy points to the Mask dancing with Tina At the end of the dance the Mask gives Tina a kiss that literally blows her shoes off, he is then confronted by Tyrell, who pulls out a gun and shoots off a part of the Mask's tie, which transforms back into Stanley's distinctive pajamas The Mask escapes, while Tyrell is temporarily arrested for the bank robbery by Lt Kellaway who also finds the pajama scrap who is also informed by a policeman that they found Freeze's dead bodyKellaway confronts Stanley at his apartment, just as a weary Stanley discovers all the bank money stuffed in his closet Stanley later consults an expert on masks named Arthur Neumann Ben Stein who tells him that the object is a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief Despite this, and with both Tyrell and Lt Kellaway hunting for him, a more confident Stanley stands up to his boss and arranges for Tina to meet the Mask at the local Landfill Park The meeting goes badly when the Mask's advances scare Tina away and Lt Kellaway arrives and attempts to arrest him The Mask toys with the enraged officer before zooming out of the park and tricking a large group of Edge City police officers into joining him in a mass-performance production of the song Cuban Pete Stanley manages to get the mask off and Peggy helps him escape, but then betrays him to Tyrell for a 50,000 mob bounty Tyrell tries on the mask and becomes a demonic monster demanding to know from Stanley where the money he took is Stanley is then shown in one of the mob cars as Tyrell's henchmen search Stanley's apartment and reclaim the money Stanley is later literally dumped in Kellaway's lap with a green rubber mask and is thrown into jailTina sympathetically visits Stanley in his cell, where he urges her to flee the city She attempts to do so, but is pursued by

1999The story opens with a man saying Ok, hit me There's a burst of TV static and the scene shifts immediately to a group of three men riding in a car They are handing out pistols to each other and covering their faces with nylon stockings The man in the back seat pulls a stocking over his head and it covers his point-of-view we realize we are witnessing the event as it happens to him, through his perspectiveThe car stops at a convenience store and the men rush in, quickly pacifying customers and the Asian owners of the store They empty the cash register and force one of the owners to empty the safe The hostages are eventually herded into a food locker and are shut inside As the robbers try to leave through the front entrance of the store, they run straight into several policemen One of the men decides to take his chances and rushes the cops The two remaining robbers are chased back through the store and out a back door which leads to a staircase They climb the stairs rapidly with the cops in fast pursuit behind them They reach the roof where a helicopter shines a light on them One of the robbers jumps across to another roof and lands safely The man whose perspective we have been watching is unable to make the jump and ends up hanging on the edge while his buddy frantically tries to pull him up The cops arrive and fire a few shots and the robber loses his grip on the ledge and plummets to the ground A burst of static is seen and we see blacknessAt that moment, Lenny Nero, who has been watching a recording of the robbery, yells and pulls a strange, spider-like device off his head He tells his technician, Tick, that he hates the kind of playback where someone dies Tick still expects full payment for the clip Lenny watched, saying he had to recover his equipment, a small recording box and the tape, a small compact disc, from the morgue Lenny agrees to pay Tick the full amount and asks Tick what other recordings he has to sellLenny himself deals in a virtual reality-type of recording where people record their personal experiences that can be played back by anyone Lenny sells them to The slang for the experience is called jacking in Lenny's argument for selling the recordings is that they allow anyone to experience life events without having to actually participate, especially in illegal activity or extra-marital affairs or pornography The technology used to create the recordings was developed by law enforcement for evidence gathering and is illegal to buy or sell in the civilian sector Lenny meets with a potential client and nearly has him convinced to buy his product when he's accosted by a cop who turns out to be his friend Max The client is scared off and Max treats Lenny to a drink Lenny, it turns out, is a former cop who was drummed out of the LAPD by his former supervisor, Commissioner StricklandAt an LA subway stop, a frightened woman is being chased by two LAPD officers She barely manages to board the subway car and one of the officers, Steckler, grabs her hair through the closing doors The woman's hair is a wig, which comes off her head Steckler shoots uselessly at the car His partner, Engleman, picks up the wig and shows it to Steckler Hidden inside is a strange-looking circuited skullcap, a SQUID Superconductive QUantum Interference Device, which records the wearer's thoughtsWhile Lenny Max enjoy their drinks, an announcement is made on the news that a famous hip-hop musician, Jeriko One, has been found murdered Jeriko had drawn much criticism from city leaders and the LAPD for openly criticizing them in his lyrics His agent, a man named Philo Gant, gives a brief commentary, saying that Jeriko was a voice for the oppressedIris shows up near the bar and drops a playback disc with a note

Peter Falk reads a favorite book to his sick grandson Fred Savage The book he reads, The Princess Bride by S Morgenstern, is about the most beautiful woman in the world, the hero who loves her, and the evil prince who says he wants to marry herThe lovely Buttercup Robin Wright is kidnapped on the eve of her wedding to Prince Humperdinck Chris Sarandon of Florin Buttercup isn't in love with Humperdinck long ago she gave her heart to Westley Cary Elwes, a farmhand But she's given Westley up for dead because his ship was captured by the notorious take-no-prisoners Dread Pirate Roberts and she's heard nothing for years, so she might as well marry Humperdinck The kidnappers carry her off in a boat and up the Cliffs of Insanity, pursued by a mysterious masked man in black At the top of the cliffs, Vizzini the Sicilian Wallace Shawn, the chief bad guy, leaves his henchman Inigo Montoya Mandy Patinkin to deal with the man in black Inigo is a superb swordsman, but in a spectacular cliff-top duel, the man in black proves to be better Sparing Inigo's life, he goes off in pursuit of Buttercup and her captors The huge and immensely strong Fezzik Andr the Giant, Vizzini's remaining henchman, tries to overpower him, but the man in black manages to choke Fezzik until he loses consciousnessWhen he catches up with Vizzini and his captive, the man in black challenges the Sicilian to a battle of wits in which one of them is sure to die He has a packet of highly poisonous iocaine powder and two goblets of wine Out of Vizzini's sight, he adds iocaine to one of the goblets He places one goblet in front of Vizzini and one in front of himself Vizzini must choose whether to drink from the goblet given to him or the one the man in black kept for himself the man in black will drink from the remaining goblet After a fevered application of logic, Vizzini chooses, drinks, and dies -- the man in black, who has spent years developing a tolerance of iocaine, has poisoned both gobletsThe man in black tells Buttercup he's the Dread Pirate Roberts and he's taking her to his ship Buttercup, infuriated that the man who killed Westley has come after her, pushes him down a mountainside As he tumbles down the steep incline, he says As you wish -- which Westley used to say to Buttercup Realizing that the man in black is Westley, Buttercup goes down after him and learns his story rather than killing him, the Dread Pirate Roberts took Westley on as his apprentice He taught Westley everything he knew, then retired, bestowing his ship and his name on Westley Westley didn't reveal himself to Buttercup at first because he didn't think she still loved himMeanwhile, Prince Humperdinck -- who of course arranged the kidnapping -- has raised the alarm and given chase He wants an excuse to go to war with Guilder, the neighboring country toward which Buttercup's captors were carrying her Westley and Buttercup flee into the fearsome Fire Swamp to escape their pursuersThe Fire Swamp offers no end of excitement hungry ROUSes rodents of unusual size, lightning sand quicksand on steroids, and unpredictable jets of flame shooting out of the ground -- but Westley gets them through it Alas, it's all for nothing they're captured by Prince Humperdinck and his men as soon as they emerge from the swampSo Buttercup makes a deal she'll go back and marry Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's freedom Humperdinck has no intention of holding up his end of the bargain and turns Westley over to his friend and lieutenant, Count Rugen Christopher Guest, as soon as Buttercup is out of earshotCount Rugen is a cruel and arrogant man whose history is tied to Inigo Montoya's Twenty years before, the count visited Inigo's father Diego Montoya, a famously skilled swordsmith, and commissioned a sword of the highest quality The job was challenging because Count Rugen who did not give his name has six fingers on his right hand"

himself by shooting flaming arrows from his cradleWith the house a shambles, Morticia and Gomez opt to hire a nanny to keep the children in check Wednesday and Pusgly make short work of every new applicant until the arrival of Debbie Jelinsky Joan Cusack, a seemingly sweet, chipper, and innocent woman who is hired on the spot Hapless Uncle Fester Christopher Lloyd, who had been pining for a romantic relationship, immediately becomes infatuated with the beautiful newcomerIt is revealed that Debbie, unbeknownst to her new employers, is a serial killer who preys on wealthy and lonely men

Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest townWhen they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstitionBy the time Renfield arrives, it is dark He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand

Nielsen makes his appearance He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed He leads Renfield up the staircase, while his shadow limps across the wall behind himAs they walk up the stairs Dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way Renfield, confused,

in the mirror, and starts making a phone call in the middle of their session, she reacts by jumping out of the window of his office and falling to her deathThe sight of Michelle's blood pooling, dark red around her bright green dress, causes Capa to suffer from stress-induced color blindness He loses the ability to see the color red The title of the film refers to the fact that, instead of red, he sees only shades of gray His friend and mentor, Dr Larry Ashland Jeff Corey, urges Bill to forgive himself for his patient's death Bill tells Larry that he's going to take some time off to visit an old college buddy in California and see if that helps give him a fresh startUpon arriving in Los Angeles, Bill's friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr Bob Moore Scott Bakula invites him

of them might be capable of murder Bill wonders what Buck might be hiding and singles out Richie as a genuine nut-case, but didn't detect a murderous vibe emanating from anyoneA couple of days later, Moore is stabbed to death in his office by a masked figure in black Police Detective Lieutenant Hector Martinez Rubn Blades suspects one of the patients of the Monday group to be the killer and he

and altered, leaving much of the world's landmass a barren desert called the Cursed Earth Most people have moved to a few mega cities, where, due to the rampant population increase, law and order have collapsed A new order has risen, that of the Street Judges, who are judge, jury and executioner, possessing the license to fight criminals, pronounce sentences and summarily execute them if necessaryWhen the story opens, Herman Fergee Ferguson is returning to Mega City 1 after serving a sentence in the Aspen Penal Colony He arrives at his new home, Heavenly Haven, which is embroiled in a vicious block war Gangsters have set up their command post in his new apartment and have opened fire on their rivals in another building and on the street, 40 stories below Fergee finds himself an unwitting accomplice, passing ammunition to the block warriorsStreet Judges Hershey and her candidate judge respond to the block war Hershey calls immediately for backup, which arrives in the form of Judge Joseph Dredd, the most famous of all the Street Judges He leads an assault on the block warriors, dispatching several of them rapidly with his pistol, the Lawgiver 2 Hershey's candidate is killed when he rushes into the command post and is shot immediately Dredd kills everyone but the block war leader and charges him with several violations of the Mega City Municipal Code, before summarily executing him for the candidate's murder He announces that court is adjourned Outside the apartment, he finds Fergee hiding in a servo-droid and finds him guilty as a repeat offender, giving him five more years in Aspen Fergee claims he's innocent and was hiding from the block warriors, however, Dredd refuses to be swayed and dismisses Fergee to re-incarceration Dredd reports to Chief Justice Fargo, who questions Dredd's hardened methods of summary execution He believes Dredd when the judge tells him that the executions were unavoidable Fargo assigns Dredd to teaching ethics at the academy a few days per weekAt the Aspen Penal Colony, Warden Miller meets with a man named Rico and gives him a small object that contains a copy of Dredd's badge and a picture of a reporter, Vartis Hammond, who has done several unfavorable reports on the Street Judges Rico suddenly unlocks a secret compartment in the box and it becomes a small pistol, which he uses to shoot Miller through the throat Miller is unable to match the voice-identification that disarms the cannons in Rico's cell and he is immediately killed by them Rico hides and is able to massacre the guards who rush into the roomAt the Academy, Dredd tells a pool of cadets about the weaponry of a street judge and how little of it matters where knowledge of the Mega City Municipal Code is concerned He also tells them that they stand a high chance of being killed on duty and that, if they live to old age, will undertake the Long Walk into the Cursed Earth, where they will teach the savage denizens outside the city walls of the law Hershey later speaks to Dredd about his obstinate personality and whether he had any friends Dredd tells her that he did have a friend at the Academy but was forced to judge and sentence him when he broke the lawRico stows away on a shuttle from Aspen in a body bag In Mega City, he goes to a pawn shop and retrieves a box set aside for him In the box is a judge's uniform and a Lawgiver pistol When Rico reaches for the pistol, the pawnshop owner warns him not to pick it up because all Lawgiver's are booby-trapped and will only recognize the grip of a street judge Rico picks up the pistol, is not harmed by the defense mechanism, and shoots the man dead, revealing that he is a judge himself Rico finds a giant combat droid, an ABC Warrior, in the shop and reactivates it, giving it

to disable the bomb there, but is too late In the violent confrontation between Quick and Trent that follows, Quick vows that Trent's career in the CIA will be over because of thisFast-forward to the present day, which is 1994 Trent is indeed out of the CIA and now works as head of security for a mobster named Joe Leon Rod Steiger, but still seeks revenge on Quick Quick has also left the CIA and now works as a free-lance bomber-for-hire He lives secretively in an abandoned waterfront warehouse he has converted into an armed bunker, and refuses to meet personally with his clients or even let

leave the horrors of the city Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills Brad Pitt, a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man Bob Mack who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould Gene Borkan, with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to goTo give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills Gwyneth Paltrow invites Somerset over for dinner While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes Realizing that this means she is supposed to spot something about the murder scene that nobody else would, the detectives have a distraught Mrs Gould Julie Araskog look at the pictures in a safe house and she notices an abstract painting that is upside down Brushing powder on the wall behind the painting, Somerset finds fingerprints outlining the words Help MeAfter running the fingerprints through AFIS, the prints are traced a day later to a pedophile named Victor Michael Reid MacKay, who escaped conviction for the rape of a minor due to the efforts of his lawyer, Eli Gould, the GREED victim SWAT and the detectives raid his apartment and find Victor to be the SLOTH victim, having been bound to his bed for one year to the day, as evidenced by pictures at the scene one taken every day from the day he is discovered Remarkably, he is still alive but suffering from severe physical and mental deterioration His hand was cut off and pushed onto the wall behind the painting to leave the prints Mills and Somerset ask to interrogate Victor in the hospital, but the doctor says that he's chewed off his tongue and that his brain is mush from the ordealThat evening, Tracy calls Somerset and requests that he meet with her The next morning, Somerset meets Tracy in a diner where she tells him how miserable she is in the city At Somerset's urging, Tracy reveals the truth of her request to meet she is pregnant, afraid of raising a child where they now live and afraid of telling David Somerset advises her to tell her husband only if she decides to have it, and he sets himself as an example he insisted his partner have an abortion, that he finally convinced her, and now he is remorsefulLater that day, using a contact in the FBI, Somerset gets a library list of people who have borrowed books

Star Addressing the camera, he starts to tell the audience why he believes in such a thing Opening up a storybook of Pinocchio, he explains how he came to the house of woodcarver Geppetto and his pets Figaro the cat and Cleo the fish Geppetto has just made a little wooden puppet called Pinocchio, whom he loves dearly Little Wooden Puppet Before he goes to bed, Geppetto wishes upon the evening star that Pinocchio would become a real, live boy As Geppetto sleeps, the Blue Fairy arrives and grants the wish partially Pinocchio has come to life, but he is still a puppet and must prove himself worthy before becoming a real boy However, being naive, he requires some guidance, and the Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy Cricket to be his conscience The cricket tells Pinocchio that anytime he needs Jiminy, all he needs to do is whistle Give a Little WhistleThe next morning, Geppetto sends his son off to school But Jiminy Cricket is still asleep Pinocchio, alone and full of good intentions, heads off to school, but is sidetracked by the wily fox John Worthington Foulfellow and his simpleton accomplice Gideon the cat Recognizing his uniqueness, the smooth-talking crooks decide to sell Pinocchio to marionette master Stromboli, whose travelling show is in town Convincing Pinocchio that this is his chance to become an actor, Honest John and Gideon take the puppet to Stromboli Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee Jiminy Cricket jumps in and tries to stop Pinocchio from being taken away, but he is too late Pinocchio becomes a success as part of Stromboli's show, dancing alongside normal puppets in a European-themed musical extravaganza I've Got No Strings Jiminy Cricket, feeling that he failed at his job, walks off into the nightPinocchio tries to return home to Geppetto Stromboli, not wanting to lose such a cash cow, locks the puppet in a bird cage Alone in Stromboli's dark and damp caravan, Pinocchio whistles for Jiminy Cricket He finds Pinocchio, but is not strong enough to unlock the bird cage Suddenly, the Blue Fairy appears Not wanting to admit he was naughty, Pinocchio tells a series of lies, but with every lie his nose grows longer The Blue Fairy forgives him and lets him out of the cage, but warns him that he'll never become human if he keeps misbehaving She also restores his nose to its original sizePinocchio and Jiminy Cricket escape from Stromboli and head for home Yet it isn't long before the duo become separated, and once more Pinocchio bumps into Honest John and Gideon, who have been hired by a dubious coachman to round up boys to take to the anarchic Pleasure Island amusement park Jiminy, realising that once again he has been too late, follows Pinocchio to Pleasure Island, where boys can be naughty as much as they like and treat themselves to beer and cigars But there's a catch to all this since they are acting like jackasses, the magic of the island gradually turns them into donkeys, which the coachman sells into a lifetime of humiliation and slavery in circuses and mines Pinocchio starts to change into a donkey, growing long ears and a tail, but before the transformation is complete he manages to flee the horrible amusement park, and returns home To his dismay, his father isn't thereA dove arrives with a note from the Blue Fairy explaining that Geppetto has gone to sea to search for his lost son and has been swallowed by the whale Monstro Determined to save his father, Pinocchio and his reluctant conscience journey to the bottom of the sea They find Geppetto in the belly of the whale, and escape by setting a fire in the belly of the sea monster, who sneezes them right out In revenge, Monstro destroys Geppetto's raft Without regard for his own safety, Pinocchio saves Geppetto from drowning but at the cost of his own life Geppetto's wish is finally granted Pinocchio's sacrifice has proved to the Blue Fairy that he is worthy, and he is brought back to life not as a puppet"

Pedro, California, a figure identified as Keyser speaks with an injured man called Keaton The two talk briefly, then Keyser appears to shoot Keaton before setting the ship ablazeThe next day, FBI Agent Jack Baer Giancarlo Esposito and US Customs special agent Dave Kujan Chazz Palminteri arrive in San Pedro separately to investigate what happened on the boat 27 people have been killed in the fire There appear to be only two survivors a crippled man named Roger 'Verbal' Kint Kevin Spacey and a hospitalized Hungarian criminal and crewman Baer interrogates the Hungarian, who claims that Keyser Sze, a Turkish criminal mastermind with a nearly mythical reputation, was in the harbor killing many men The Hungarian begins to describe Sze while a translator interprets and a police sketch artist draws a rendering of Sze's faceMeanwhile, Verbal Kint tells the authorities everything he knows in exchange for immunity After making his statement to the district attorney, Kint is placed in a police station office where Kujan requests to hear the story again, from the beginningVerbal's tale starts six weeks earlier in New York City, when an armored truck containing spare gun parts is hijacked in Queens The driver of the stolen truck was grabbed from behind and never saw the person or persons who acosted him, but the unknown hijacker spoke to him Subsequently, the NYPD round up five different criminals Dean Keaton Gabriel Byrne is a corrupt former police officer who has apparently given up his life of crime, and is arrested while eating dinner at a fancy restaurant Michael McManus Stephen Baldwin is a crack shot with a temper and a wild streak, arrested in the middle of the night Fred Fenster Benicio Del Toro is McManus's hispanic partner who speaks in mangled English, and is nabbed on a street corner Todd Hockney Kevin Pollak is a hijacker who forms an instant rivalry with McManus, and is picked up while working on a car in his garage and Verbal himself, who is a con artist that suffers from cerebral palsy The five men are brought together for a lineup, and are told to say the phrase, Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker They all manage to butcher the phrase Later, while sitting in a holding cell, McManus convinces the others to join forces to commit a robbery targeting New York's Finest Taxi service, a group of corrupt NYPD police officers who escort smugglers to their destinations around the city Their attack on one smuggler goes off without a hitch, with farther reaching consequences as numerous other officers are indicted on corruption chargesWith their loot, the quintet travels to California to sell it to McManus's fence, Redfoot Peter Greene Redfoot talks them into another job robbing a purported jewel smuggler Instead of jewels or money, as they were told he was carrying, the smuggler had heroin An angry confrontation between the thieves and Redfoot reveals that the job came from a lawyer named Kobayashi Pete Postlethwaite They later meet with Kobayashi, who claims to work for Keyser Sze and blackmails them into destroying the cargo of a ship coming to San Pedro harborIn the present, Verbal Kint tells Kujan the story of Keyser Sze as he apparently heard it Verbal's flashback reveals Sze's family being harassed by a rival Hungarian gang in Turkey Sze goes on a murderous vendetta against all those who were involved Afterwards, he apparently disappears thereafter, he rarely conducts business without an alias and maintains anonymity between himself and anyone working for him With time, Sze's story takes on mythic stature, with most people either doubting his existence or disbelieving it entirelyBack in the present, Kint continues to tell his version of what happened then His flashback resumes to reveal Fenster's attempt to run away, but he is tracked and killed off-camera by Kobayashi The remaining four thieves kidnap Kobayashi, believing Sze to be a cover for his activities and intending to kill

continental mainland by flooding the San Fernando Valley now called the San Fernando Sea and turning it into an island from Malibu to Anaheim Just prior to this, an American presidential candidate an obscure reference to Jerry Falwell played by Cliff Robertson, who is also an out-spoken, Christian theocracist, had made a doomsday prediction of the disaster during his campaign, saying LA was a city of sin, and that Like the mighty hand of God, waters will rise up and separate this sinful, sinful city, from our countryIn the chaos that followed, the candidate is elected as the new President and a new constitutional amendment appoints him for life in office This President declares that all people not conforming to the new Moral America laws he sets for the country banning such things as smoking, alcoholic beverages, red meat, owning firearms, profanity, non-Christian religions including atheism, and non-marital sex will lose their citizenship and be deported to Los Angeles Island Like New York City in Escape from New York, Los Angeles is turned into a penal colony of sorts A containment wall is built around the shores of the mainland, armed guards and watchtowers are posted everywhere and those sent to the island are exiled permanentlyIn 2013, Cuervo Jones Georges Corraface, a Che Guevara-like Shining Path Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the President's daughter, Utopia AJ Langer, via a holographic internet system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the Sword of Damocles super weapon a series of high-tech satellites capable of destroying electronics anywhere on the planet using a focused electromagnetic pulse The President had threatened to use the system to render enemies of America unable to function, and eventually dominate the world Utopia gets away in an escape pod from Air Force Three and lands on LA Island to be with CuervoWith the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back America with the assistance of an allied invasion force of Latin American nations that are standing by for his signal to attack Cuervo threatens that if the President tries to stop him, he'll pull the plug on the country and demonstrates his power by blacking out the capital which has been moved to the President's hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, also the real-life hometown of Jerry Falwell Cuervo also knows the secret world code, which is 666, that can activate all the satellites and knock out power for the entire planetMeanwhile, Snake Plissken Kurt Russell, is captured for another series of crimes The Duty Sergeant Peter Jason welcomes Snake to the deportation area, but he instead escorts Snake and leaves him in a vacant room A minute later, the President, the police base camp commander Malloy Stacey Keech Jr and his aide Brazen Michelle Forbes arrive and offer him a deal Snake will go to the island as an exile to retrieve the remote device The President says he will give Snake a full pardon for all the crimes he has ever committed if he is successful The President indicates he doesn't care if Utopia is returned or not, saying she is a traitor and dead to me Initially, Snake refuses to get involved, but to ensure his compliance, Malloy tells Snake that he was secretly infected minutes earlier with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus which will kill him within 9 hours If he completes the mission, Snake will be given the antidoteSnake is given a sub-machine gun, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live The virus works fast, and Snake is given only nine hours to find the device and get out before he dies Like New York, Los Angeles is now in ruins, and a hot-bed of crime Snake sneaks into the city with a nuclear-powered mini submarine which he soon loses when the unsturdy platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to s"

July 20, 1969, in the home of astronaut Jim Lovell Tom Hanks Jim and a number of other NASA families are gathered to watch the moon walk by Apollo 11's astronauts Later on, Jim contemplates how close he came to the moon when he was orbiting it on Apollo 8, and thinks about one day setting foot on the moon, as his wife Marilyn Kathleen Quinlan tries to keep from thinking of her husband going off on another missionSome months later, Jim is informed that due to an ear-infection by one of the Apollo 13 crew, he and his crew members have been bumped up to become the Prime Crew for the mission Marilyn has some misgivings, given the shortened schedule and that the mission number is 13, but Jim is confident they'll be readyJim works with his crew members Fred Haise Bill Paxton and Ken Mattingly Gary Sinise, and the three seem well prepared for their mission It is shortly before the launch, that Marilyn hints to Jim about her misgivings about the flight, but Jim assures her she's going to miss a great showAfter their discussion, Jim and his crew members attend a small press conference, where they discuss the different ways that the number '13' has worked into the launch Apollo 13, launching at 1300 hours and 13 minutes, and orbiting the moon on April 13th Jim also surprises the press and the crew, when he declares that the mission will also be his lastWith days before the mission, the Flight Surgeon reveals that one of the backups has the measles, and the crew has been exposed to it The Flight Surgeon feels that since Ken Mattingly has not had the measles before, he is in serious risk of becoming sick during the mission Jim is then given a choice he can have Ken Mattingly replaced with his backup, Jack Swigert Kevin Bacon, or the Apollo 13 crew as a whole can be pushed back to a later mission Though he is upset by the choices, Jim chooses to replace KenThe crew continues to train in the simulator, though they are not as confident in Jack's piloting skills as Ken's Even so, Jim promises they'll be ready for the launchOn the day of the launch, Ken watches from a distance, as the rocket takes off, with Marilyn Lovell and Fred Haise's wife Mary Tracy Reiner in attendance near the launch siteEventually, the crew are able to successfully dock the Command Module with the LEM Lunar Excursion Module, Swigert's piloting skills be up to the task, and the mission continues toward the Moon The crew also broadcasts a video of being inside the craft, but due to feelings that moon missions aren't exciting anymore, none of the television networks carry the transmissionShortly after the video feed, the crew makes some 'housekeeping procedures' on the ship, Jim Swigert is asked to stir the oxygen tanks Suddenly, a loud bang is heard, and the ship begins to pitch out of control, with the system buttons lighting up, and the oxygen tanks beginning to failMission Control led by Gene Kranz Ed Harris springs into action, attempting to find some way to stop the leak At the insistence of EECOM member Sy Liebergot Clint Howard, it is suggested to shut down the fuel cells to prevent further leakage However, this move comes at a price with the fuel cells closed, that means the chance to land on the moon will not go through The procedure is met with some trepidation by Jim Lovell, but the crew makes the moveonly for the oxygen level in the Command Module to continue to plummetWith 15 minutes of oxygen remaining in the Command Module, an emergency transfer is made to transfer computer information and the astronauts into the LEM, utilizing it as a lifeboatEventually, the crew are secure in the LEM, and Gene Kranz and his men attempt to figure out the best way to bring the men home While some are for a 'direct abort' having the crew turn the ship around and head back to Earth immediately using the Command Module, Gene says it's too risky to light its engine, as they don't know to what extent the 'explosion' that was reported has affected

man, Joe Gillis Holden floats in the swimming pool of a palatial mansion As the police begin converging on the house Joe's voice narrates, in flashback style, the events leading up to his own murderSix months earlier, Joe was down on his luck, unable to find work as a screenwriter, having only made a few undistinguished films in his short career Broke and on the verge of having his car repossessed, with no other options except a low-paying newspaper job in Ohio, Joe tries to persuade Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake Clark to buy his most recent script, but fails after script reader Betty Schaefer Olson gives Sheldrake a harsh critique of the script in her summation Joe then tries unsuccessfully to borrow money from his friends Fleeing from repossession men in his car, one of Joe's tires blows out in front of a large and seemingly deserted mansion on Sunset Hiding the car in the garage, he sets out to explore the decaying house, when a woman inside calls to him Mistaken for the undertaker to a recently deceased pet chimpanzee, he is ushered in by the mysterious butler, Max Von Mayerling Von Stroheim Meeting the woman who owns the house, he recognizes her as long-forgotten silent-film star Norma Desmond Swanson When she learns that he is a writer, she invites him in and asks for his opinion on an immense script she has written for a film about Salome that she hopes will revive her faded acting career Although Joe finds the script awful, he flatters Norma into hiring him as an editorJoe is put up in her guest room The next morning he objects when he sees that Max has moved his belongings to the mansion on Norma's orders, and that she has paid his overdue rent Though he hates being dependent on her, he accepts the situation and begins living at the mansion, first in a room over the garage, then in the mansion itself As he works on Norma's script, he comes to see how unaware she is of how her fame has died She refuses to hear any criticism of her work, and makes him watch her old films in the evenings Although she still receives fan mail, Joe later learns that Max feeds into Norma's fantasy by sending the letters himself He explains that Norma's state of mind is fragile, and she has attempted suicide in the pastOver the next few weeks, Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothing, including a tuxedo for a private New Year's Eve party attended only by the two of them Horrified to learn that she has fallen in love with him, he tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room Joe, thinking his time with her is over, escapes to a party at his friend, assistant director Artie Green's Webb house, where he meets Betty Schaefer again While still unimpressed with most of his work, she believes a scene in one of his scripts has potential Joe half-agrees to work on it with her, and calls the house on Sunset to tell Max he is leaving However, when Max informs him that Norma has attempted suicide with Joe's razor blade, Joe leaves the party and returns to the mansion, where he apologizes to Norma and makes love to herAfter a while, Norma considers her script complete, and sends it to Cecil B DeMille at Paramount and waits for his answer Not long afterwards, calls from Paramount asking for Norma begin to arrive They come from an executive named Gordon Cole, and Norma petulantly refuses to speak to anyone other than DeMille himself Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to the studio in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A, a rare vintage luxury car While DeMille

paragraph there will be a warning untilyou have seen the movieImmortal Beloved is a biographical account of Ludwig van Beethoven'sGary Oldman life and loves, in the form of a fictionalized treatmentof an enigmatic letter to his immortal beloved that was found afterhis death The letter, the mystery about the addressee's identity,and a great many other aspects of Beethoven's life, are treatedreasonably authentically in the movie But the identity of theimmortal beloved indicated in the movie should be regarded asfictionalThe movie is structured like Citizen Kane---a mystery is revealed uponBeethoven's death, and the movie is a long series of flashbacksthrough Beethoven's life as his secretary and confidant AntonSchindler Jeroen Krabb scours the countryside attempting to solvethe matter The mystery is the discovery of an unofficial willfound among Beethoven's papers upon his death, bequeathing allhis property to an unnamed immortal beloved, along with a passionatelove letter to her Schindler vows to find out who she was, and thuscarry out Beethoven's last wish, keenly aware of how society hadfailed Beethoven throughout his life He is opposed in this byBeethoven's surviving brother Johann Gerard Horan and Johann's wifeTherese Alexandra Pigg, who feel that the estate should be theirs,based on an earlier official will, and as compensation for the abusethey endured from LudwigSchindler Anton Schindler really was Beethoven's secretary andassistant, and apparently really was as sycophantic in real life ashis depiction in the movie sets out for the hotel in Karlsbad wherethe letter was sent During this journey, a voice-over recites partof the letter, while the slow 2nd movement of Beethoven's 5thEmperor piano concerto plays The letter explains his ardent lovefor this woman, while explaining that he has been delayed, by aserious coach breakdown, from seeing herThe proprietress, Frau Streicher Miriam Margolyes, tells him thatBeethoven had indeed come there many years before to stay with a womanwho had checked in earlier This woman did not give her name, andcovered herself in a veil at all times A letter from Beethovenarrived, and she took it to the room, along with a meal, after openingit to find out what room it should go to---Immortal beloved was notan adequate address The woman apparently did not like the letter,because she checked out shortly thereafter Then Beethoven arrived,saw that the woman had left, and went on a rampage, destroyingfurniture and breaking a window An extensive search of the hotel'spast registry books yields the page on which the woman signed in, butthe name is illegible Frau Streicher lets Schindler tear out the pageand take it with himSchindler then goes to see various women who were known to have beenpersonally involved with Beethoven, beginning with GiuliettaGuicciardi Valeria Golino She tells Schindler of her fascinationwith Beethoven, her desire to marry him, and his rather eccentric andboorish behavior Because Beethoven was rumored to be extremely shyabout performing on the piano the real reason was his approachingdeafness she arranges to have a very new and expensive piano broughtto the house, and she tells Beethoven that everyone will be away andhe can try it out He does so, playing the Moonlight Sonata while hishead is pressed against the top of the piano so that he can hear it aswell as possible Giulietta, along with her fatherLuigi Diberti, have been hiding an an adjacent room She is somoved by his playing that she comes out of hiding, walks up toBeethoven without his seeing her, and touches him Beethoven recoilsin horror, shouting It is terrible to rob me in this way of my mosttreasured feelings It soon becomes clear to Giulietta and herfather that Beethoven is deaf Shortly afterwards, Giulietta marriedCount Gallenburg, another composerSchindler ret"

brilliant young psychoanalyst Constance Peterson Ingrid Bergman is known for being quite aloof from the romantic advances of her fellow doctors She is only interested in her work The head of the institution, the elderly Dr Murchison Leo G Carroll is retiring, involuntarily He had had an episode of nervous exhaustion from overwork, and the board had decided that this could happen again and he needed to retire He is to be replaced by the renowned young Dr Edwardes, who has published an acclaimed book about guilt complexesDr Edwardes Gregory Peck arrives There is immediate magnetism between him and Dr Peterson But some disturbing developments occur At dinner on the first evening, he has a bizarre and inappropriate outburst upon seeing Dr Peterson draw the outline of a proposed swimming pool, using the tines of her fork, on a linen napkinAs the days go by, the friendship between Drs Edwardes and Peterson grows closer She goes to his room late one evening, and they declare their love for each other But while they are embracing, he has another bizarre reaction upon seeing the parallel stripes on her white robe Then he receives a phone call One of the patients has become very agitated and tried to cut his throat he is in surgery Drs Edwardes and Peterson go there Dr Edwardes has a serious panic attack in the operating room He is taken to his own room While Dr Peterson is watching over him, she notices that his autograph in a copy of his book, which she has borrowed from the library, is very different from the signature on a note that he had written to her This person is not Dr EdwardesWhen he wakes up, Dr Peterson confronts him He says that he does not know who he is He killed the real Dr Edwardes, and is taking his place He has complete amnesia His only connection to reality is that he has a cigarette case with the monogram JB She says that she trusts him completely, and will help him The police will not come immediately, and she may be able to

McClintock and William Ford, destroy the camp where it was found after taking blood samples from the dying victimsTwenty-eight years later, in 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate He and his crew, Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler, and new recruit Major Salt gain information about the virus and return to the United States, where Daniels asks his superior, now-Brigadier General William Ford, to put out an alert Ford knows that the virus is not new, but he tells Daniels it is unlikely to show up Daniels' ex-wife and former crew-member Roberta Keough, has left USAMRIID to take the lead role of a similar team at the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia and is convinced by Daniels to recommend an alert from the CDC, but her superior balks as wellMeanwhile, we learn that the virus arrived via a host animal, a white-headed capuchin monkey, that was smuggled into the United States James Jimbo Scott, an employee at the Bio-Test animal holding facility, bribed a security guard and took the monkey to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market During the drive, Jimbo is infected with the virus through facial contact with the monkey's salivaJimbo unsuccessfully tries to sell the monkey to a crooked pet store owner, Rudy Alvarez Before parting ways, however, the monkey scratches Alvarez and infects him, and shares a banana with another monkey already in the store, infecting that monkey as well Not able to care for the monkey, Jimbo releases it into the woods Jimbo starts to show signs of infection while flying to Boston, where he gets off the plane and kisses his girlfriend Alice, infecting her as well just before collapsing They are both hospitalized Keough investigates the infections but finds that no one other than Jimbo, his girlfriend or Rudy all three of whom die of hemorrhagic fever in the Boston area was infectedMeanwhile, the technicians at a Cedar Creek hospital run tests on Rudy's blood But Henry, one of the technicians, accidentally breaks a vial, splattering the contents, infecting and killing him, but not before visiting a movie theater The virus mutates into a new strain, capable of spreading like flu, and numerous Cedar Creek citizens are exposed to Motaba at the theater Daniels learns of the infection and flies to Cedar Creek alongside Schuler and Salt, against Ford's orders, joining Keough's teamAs Daniels and his team begin a search for the host animal, a state of martial law is declared in Cedar Creek, and the US Army has quarantined the town to contain the outbreak, including preventing an attempt by civilians from breaking quarantine During their research, Schuler is infected when his suit tears Keough

Motaba Daniels soon realizes that the serum is not experimental, but was designed to cure Motaba, and that Ford knew about the virus beforehand However, the serum does not help the residents of Cedar

is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan Norman Lloyd, who states the academy's four pillars Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence Todd meets Neil Perry Robert Sean Leonard an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommateLater in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father Kurtwood Smith to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will Also, Mr Perry tells Neil that Mrs Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyerDuring the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the math teacher who states that all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow In stark contrast to these orthodox teaching methods, the guys see a different side of the school when they attend English class taught by the newly arrived and liberal-minded Mr Keating Robin Williams, whom they met briefly during the orientation -- Keating tells his class he was also a student at Welton Helton as the students secretly refer to the institution himself many years ago Keating enters his class whistling the 1812 Overture, and he first takes the boys out in the hallway to the school's displays cases containing artifacts of the school's sports achievements He tells them that they all have the potential to become powerful individuals, and they are responsible for what their futures will hold These two actions show his difference from the other teachers because no other teacher would commit the actions he does Also, he tells the boys they may call him Oh Captain, my Captain, if they dare These examples of Mr Keating's teachings show the boys how to think for themselves Mr Keating then tells the boys Carpe Diem, which is Latin for seize the dayIn addition to Todd and Neil, a small group of other students whom include the lovesick Knox Overstreet Josh Charles, the flip Charlie Dalton Gale Hansen, the pragmatic Richard Cameron Dylan Kussman, liberal Steven Meeks Allelon Ruggiero and the moderate Gerard Pitts James Waterston, also react to the first day's lesson with comments from that was weird to neat Cameron asks if anything Keating told them will be on a future test and the boys respond with mild scornThe next day Keating starts the class with a traditional teaching approach by having Neil read out loud the introduction to their poetry textbook, which describes how to rate the quality of poetry according to mathematical plotting Keating finds such mathematical criticism ridiculous and instructs his pupils to rip out the essay which is one of three ways that he demonstrates freedom of expression and non-conformity When some students hesitate, he tells them this is not the Bible This is a battle, a war You will have to learn to think for yourselves He later has the students stand on his desk as a reminder to look at the world in a different wayA few days later, Knox Overstreet is asked to attend a dinner party at the Danburry household, friends of his parents When he arriv"

Yugoslavia, early morning, 6 April 1941, as two roguish bon vivants Petar Popara nicknamed Crni Blacky and Marko Dren are heading home following a night out on the town Riding atop a horse carriage while tailed and serenaded by a brass orchestra, they're drunkenly singing and shooting their way through the city's downtown They pass through Kalemegdan and shout salutes to Marko's brother Ivan who's an animal keeper in the Belgrade Zoo A stutterer with a lame leg, Ivan is already up to feed the animals and waves to them warmly as he records food portion amounts while listening to early morning radio bulletinsAs the drunk duo pulls up in front of Blacky's home, his pregnant wife Vera comes out to angrily usher her husband into the house while threatening to leave him just like Marko's wife left Marko Intoxicated Marko pulls Vera aside and lets her know that they enrolled Blacky in the Communist Party KPJ, but she's way too angry about Blacky's irresponsible behaviour as a husband to properly process that piece of information Blacky goes into the house while Marko proceeds on and picks up a street prostitute before disappearing into his house with herPart One War1941A couple of hours later, as Sunday dawns, Ivan is making rounds at the zoo to feed the animals, hungover Blacky is eating breakfast while pregnant Vera complains about his supposed affair with a theatre actress, and Marko is preparing for sex with his prostitute as he lecherously watches her take a scrub in his bath tub Suddenly, the roar of the planes is heard, and Nazi bombs begin falling on Belgrade In the ensuing chaos, as people run for cover including Ivan desperately trying to save his beloved animals, unflinching Blacky and Marko show no signs of panic The former stubbornly sits at his table eating his breakfast, cursing the Nazis as his wife pleads with him to go to the shelter, while the latter is about to climax with the prostitute on top of him when suddenly, frightened by the bombs, she runs away in horror thus forcing him to finish himself offAfter the air raid is over, Blacky goes out against the wishes of his wife and inspects the devastated city Encountering building ruins and escaped wild animals from the zoo, he also runs into disconsolate Ivan carrying a baby chimp named Soni Blacky's parting piece of advice to his best friend's brother is a stern Stop crying You want the Germans to see you like that and laugh at you before giving him some money to buy milk for the monkeyRoyal Yugoslav Army's resistance is quickly broken, and Nazis soon occupy and dismember the entire Kingdom of Yugoslavia Blacky starts operating clandestinely as a communist activist along with Marko and others Their activism mostly consists of stealing German weapons shipments as well as jewellery and other valuables from the city's elite In theory, the idea is to send all the weapons and money made from the stolen goods to Partisan guerrillas fighting in the woods, however, much to Blacky's dissatisfaction, many of the 'activists' are using the rackets for personal gainBlacky occasionally visits his mistress Natalija Zovkov who's been assigned to a special actors' labour brigade that's helping the city's rebuilding effort under German occupational control An acclaimed, pampered, and celebrated actress in the National Theatre, Natalija is finding it hard to adapt to manual labour, especially as she has a sick, wheelchair-bound brother Bata to take care of On one of his visits to the site where she's cleaning bricks, Blacky brings her a stolen necklace, which cheers her up momentarily, but she now generally sees their relationship as a liability fearing that it could only bring her trouble like being sent to the prison camp, especially after she heard about the bounty prize the Germans have set for his capture However, she's no"

back through the jungle The man who expertly wields the bullwhip is Dr Henry Indiana Jones, Jr Harrison Ford, an archaeologist with a reputation for heavy-handed field work that takes him around the globe in search of ancient treasuresIndy and his remaining companion, Sapito Alfred Molina, enter a dank and oppressively vast cave, where a competitor of his, Forrestal, disappeared Inside the cave

pedestal and is protected by an elaborate system of pressure-sensitive stones that release deadly darts from the surrounding walls Jones avoids the booby-trapped stones and makes it to the idol He very deftly replaces the idol with a bag of sand, judging the weight of the treasure by sight However, the weight is not precise, the pedestal sinks and the chamber begins to disintegrate Jones runs, narrowly avoiding the darts When he arrives at a bottomless pit he Sapito had crossed earlier using Jones' bullwhip, Sapito crosses safely but refuses to give Jones his whip unless he gives him the

burial site of the Ark of the Covenant The Ark was built by ancient Hebrews to hold the stone tablets on which Moses inscribed the Ten Commandments It holds immense mystical power -- enough to allow the Nazis to level mountains and lay waste to entire regionsIndy flies to Nepal followed by a Nazi agent, Toht Ronald Lacey to confront Marion Ravenwood, who runs a restaurant and bar and who can

her training at the FBI Training Facility at Quantico, Virginia by Jack Crawford of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, who tasks her with presenting a VICAP questionnaire to the notorious Dr Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant forensic psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial murderer After learning the assignment relates to the pursuit of vicious serial killer Buffalo Bill, Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and is led by Dr Frederick Chilton to Hannibal Lecter, a sophisticated, cultured man restrained behind thick glass panels and windowless stone walls Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at dissecting him and viciously rebuffs her As Starling departs, another patient flings fresh semen onto her face, enraging Lecter who calls Starling back and offers a riddle containing information about a former patient The solved riddle leads to a rent-a-storage lot where the severed head of Benjamin Raspail is found Starling returns to Lecter, who links Raspail to Buffalo Bill and who offers to help profile Buffalo Bill if he is transferred to a facility far from the venomous, careerist Dr ChiltonHours and miles away, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of United States Senator Ruth Martin Starling is pulled from Quantico and accompanies Crawford to West Virginia, where the body of Bill's recently-discovered victim resides, and where Starling helps perform the autopsy and extracts the chrysalis of a Death's-head Hawkmoth from the victim's throat At Quantico, as news of Catherine Martin's abduction sweeps the country, Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Hannibal Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps profile Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine Martin Instead, Lecter begins a game of quid pro quo with Starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about Buffalo Bill in exchange for events from Starling's traumatic childhood Unaware to both Starling and Lecter, Dr Frederick Chilton tapes the conversation and after revealing Starling's deal as a sham, offers to transfer Lecter in exchange for a deal of his own making Lecter agrees and following a flight to Tennessee reveals Buffalo Bill's real name, physical description and past address to Senator Martin and her entourage of FBI agents and Justice Department officialsAs the manhunt begins, Starling travels to Lecter's special cell in a local Tennessee courthouse, where she confronts him about the false information he gave the Senator Lecter refuses Starling's pleas and demands she finish her story surrounding her worst childhood memory After recounting her arrival at a relative's farm, the horror of discovering their lamb slaughterhouse and her fruitless attempts at rescuing the lambs, Lecter rebuffs her, leaving her with her case file before she is escorted out of the building by security guards Later that evening, Lecter escapes from his cell The local police storm the floor, discovering one guard barely alive and the other disemboweled and strung up on the walls Paramedics transport the survivor to an ambulance and speed off while a SWAT team searches the building for Lecter As the team discover a body in the elevator shaft, the survivor in the ambulance peels off his own face, revealing Lecter in disguise, who kills the paramedics and escapes to the airportAfter notified of Lecter's escape, Starling pores over her case file, analyzing Lecter's annotations before realizing that the first victim, Frederica Bimmel, knew Bill in real life before he killed her Starling travels to Bimmel's hometown and discovers that Bimmel was a tailor and has dresses with templates identical to the patches of skin removed from Buffalo Bill's victims Realizing that Buffalo Bill is a tailor fashioning a woman suit of real skin, she telephones Crawford, who is already on the way to make a"

off the eastern coast of Russia, the Alabama runs drills When a fire breaks out in the galley, Hunter rushes to help put the blaze out At that moment, Ramsey orders a missile launching drill to be performed Hunter is perturbed that Ramsey would order a drill in the midst of an emergency but reports to the bridge to oversee the transfer of coded transmissions and report to Ramsey During a lull

to be taken advantage of Hunter still obviously disagrees, however, he chooses not to say soThe Alabama receives an emergency action message EAM informing them that Radchenko is very close to breaking

crude oil proclaiming in front of the entire family that he will be richer than the Benedicts After Jett makes a rude sexual remark to Leslie, Bick and Jett have a fist fightShortly after, in the 1930s, Jett starts an oil drilling company, named 'JetTexas' that makes him enormously wealthy But Bick resists the lure of drilling for oil on his much larger part of the cattle ranch, preferring to remain a rancher to maintain the legacy of his family's original businessDuring the 1940s, tensions in the Benedict household revolve around how the parents want to bring up their grown-up children Bick stubbornly insists that Jordy must succeed him and run the ranch, just like his father and grandfather before him, but Jordy wants to be a doctor Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but Judy loves the ranch and wants to stay in Texas for her education and to her high school boyfriendAfter World War II breaks out, Jett visits the Benedicts and tries to convince Bick to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort Bick finally realizes there is no one to take over the ranch after him, and concedes During this visit, Luz II, now a teen-aged girl, starts flirting with Jett Once oil production starts, the wealthy Benedict family becomes even wealthier, depicted by the addition of a swimming pool next to the house Jordy gets married to a young Mexican-American woman and they have a son Judy gets married to her long-term high school boyfriend and they too have a sonThe BenedictRink rivalry continues however, and it comes to a head when the Benedicts find out that Luz II and the much older Jett Rink have been dating At a huge gala Jett organizes in his own honor, an irate Jordy tries to fight him, after realizing he and his Mexican American wife, Juana Elsa Crdenas, were invited just so Jett's employees could turn Juana away Jett has his goons hold Jordy and punches him out in front of the crowd Fed up, Bick then takes Jett to a kitchen room, about to fight him, but realizes that Jett is now just a drunken shell of a man, who has only his money He tells him, You're not even worth hitting You're all through, and leaves, but

Alistair Stewart Sam Neill She is shipped off along with her young daughter Flora McGrath Anna Paquin Ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old, expressing herself instead through her piano playing and through sign language for which her daughter has served as the interpreter Ada cares little for the mundane world, occupying herself for hours every day with the piano It is never made explicitly clear why she ceased to speak Flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher whom Ada believed she could control with her mind, making him love her, but who became frightened and stopped listening, and thus left herAda, Flora and their belongings, including the piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by the ship's crew against her angry objections As there is no one there to meet them, they spend the night alone, sheltering under a tiny tent made of a hoop skirt frame The following day, Alistair arrives with a Mori crew and his friend Baines Harvey Keitel, a fellow forester and a retired sailor, who has adopted many of the Maori customs, including tattooing his face and socializing with the Maori instead of his own race save Alistair There are insufficient men to carry everything and Alistair abandons the piano, again eliciting objections from AdaAlistair proves to be a shy and diffident man, who is jokingly called old dry balls by his Maori cohorts He tells Ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano Ada, in turn, makes no effort to befriend him and continues to try to be reunited with her piano Unable to communicate with Alistair, she goes, with Flora, to Baines and asks to be taken to the piano He agrees, and the three spend the day as she plays tunes on the beach While he socially allies himself with the Maori, Baines has steadfastly refused any sexual activity with their women But he clearly finds Ada attractive due to her passion for music Baines eventually retrieves the instrument and suggests that Alistair trade it and lessons from Ada for some land that Alistair wants Alistair consents, oblivious to the budding attraction between Ada and Baines She is surprised to find that he has had the piano put into perfect tune after its rough journey He asks to simply listen rather than learn to play himself, and then offers to let her buy the piano back, one key at a time, by letting him do 'things he likes' while she plays Ada ambivalently agrees as she is attracted to Baines In the meantime, Ada and Alistair have had no sexual, or even mildly affectionate, interaction even though they are by now formally marriedBaines is sexually aroused by Ada's playing to the point that he openly approaches her Finally, she yields to her own lust one afternoon, and she and Baines have sex Alistair finally begins to suspect the love affair and after discovering them, he angrily boards up his home with Ada inside when he goes off to work on his timberland After that interlude, Ada avoids Baines and feigns affection with Alistair, though her caresses only serve to frustrate him more because when he makes a move to touch her in return, she pulls away Before Alistair departs on his next journey, he asks Ada if she will go to see Baines she shakes her head 'no' and he tells her he trusts that she won't go to him while he's goneSoon after, Ada sends her daughter with a package

Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps FA-18 Hornets from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, as they participate in an assault on the destroyer that has devastated the city of Los Angeles Their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's force field, and it responds by releasing scores of smaller attacker ships which are similarly shielded and armed with high-energy torpedoes One-sided dogfights ensue

of the canyon wall and lands in the desert Captain Hiller parachutes to a landing close by and angrily marches over to find and confront whatever life form is in the alien craft The door to the alien

one spontaneously combusted while another choked on his own vomitSpinal Tap is being transported to their next gig, and to pass the time they're reading the autobiography of Rat Pack member Sammy Davis Jr The limo driver has a one-sided conversation with them about Frank Sinatra's history The next song being played is their smash hit single Big Bottom We also learn how Spinal Tap's back catalog was received by critics Most of the albums received rather mixed reviews, but one album called Shark Sandwich received just a two word review - Shit sandwich Their religious rock album The Gospel According To Spinal Tap was also rather poorly receivedTheir next stop takes them to Atlanta for the Recording Industry Convention There, they learn a couple of gigs were canceled, but nothing to be worried about While there, they're presented with the finished copies of their new album, but are completely shocked that it's all black It appears that the record label marketing department was completely offended by the proposed cover as stores have said they flat out weren't going to sell the album, citing it as filth Spinal Tap's promoters get into a huge argument with the record label CEO who cites their album cover as sexistWhile backstage for their next gig in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Nigel is complaining about the quality or complete lack thereof of the food being presented to them He tells the manager that it's a complete catastrophe and that they wouldn't like being served that food either The next song they play is Hell Hole which is rather well received by the theater crowd During the song David gets in a rather tense guitar solo and falls to the ground requiring roadies to pick him up The next day Marti is going over Nigel's massive amounts of equipment that they transport from show to show He then explains how their amplifiers don't end at 10, they go to 11 which is one louder Their next gig in Charlotte proves to be another disaster when their gig is cancelled due to a lack of advertising fundsThe next interview with Marti we learn that Spinal Tap has a dwindling audience At the start of last year's tour they were booked into 10,000 and 15,000 seat arenas Now they're being booked into 4,000 and 6,000 seat arenas They proceed to take out their frustrations by destroying their hotel room As Nigel is on the phone to their promoter, they learn that a number of their gigs across the Midwest have been cancelled But thankfully they're saved when Derek informs them that a song they recorded in the past called Listen To The Flower People was being played on the local radio But their happiness is short lived when the announcer refers to them in the where are they now segmentThankfully Spinal Tap has managed to secure a gig in Memphis There, they pay tribute to"

the 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce, The Women follows the lives of a handful of wealthy Manhattan women, focusing in particular on Mary Haines Norma Shearer, the cheerful, contented wife of Stephen

that Mary's husband has been having an affair with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen Joan Crawford A notorious gossip, Sylvia delights in sharing the news with Mary's other friends, and sets up Mary with an appointment with Olga so that she hears the same rumor about Stephen's infidelity While Mary's mother, Mrs Morehead Lucile Watson, urges her to ignore the gossip concerning the affair and continue on as if nothing has happened, Mary begins to have her own suspicions about her husband's increasingly frequent claims that he needs to work late, and decides to travel to Bermuda with her mother to think about the situation and hope that the affair and the rumors surrounding it will fade Upon her return from Bermuda a few weeks later, feeling well-rested and more sure of herself, Mary heads out to a fashion show at a high-end clothing store and learns that Crystal is in attendance, trying on clothes from the show in a dressing room across the hall Sylvia joins Mary and baits her into storming into Crystal's dressing room and confronting her about the affair Crystal is completely unapologetic about her ongoing affair with Stephen and is satisfied with her meal ticket, but does reveal that Stephen's strong feelings of sentiment prevents him from seeking a divorce from Mary in order to marry her Heartbroken and humiliated by the revelation of the affair, Mary

EditionThe movie opens with shots of traffic and children in playgrounds The sounds of children's voices die out, followed by a flash-forward to Los Angeles in 2029 AD The world has become a wasteland of wrecked cars, destroyed buildings, and black-charred playgrounds filled with skeletons and skulls The voice of Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton narrates 3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997 The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day They only lived to face a new nightmare the war against the machinesThe foot of a metallic android smashes a skull on the ground A battle starts between human guerrilla troops and a technically far superior robotic army Crushing skulls beneath their tracks, robotic tanks open a full-frontal assault on the humans, who are trained to make use of what shelter the ruined terrain offers them Flying aircraft search the ground for targets as T-800 androids sweep the terrain at places the tanks cannot access Although they suffer heavy losses, the humans manage to destroy several tanks, aircraft and androids They even use old cars as crude assault vehicles, but the machines' laser cannons are accurate and unrelentingJohn Connor is saluted by his soldiers as he crosses a destroyed hallway and inspects the battlefield from a safe distance The camera zooms in on his scarred face as Sarah's voice-over continues Skynet, the computer that controlled the machines, sent two terminators back through time Their mission to destroy the leader of the human resistance John Connor, my son The first Terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year 1984, before John was born It failed The second was set to strike at John himself when he was just a child As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior as a protector for John It was just a question of which one would reach him firstThe opening credits play in a montage of shots of playgrounds burning in an inferno The credits end as the camera zooms in on the metal face of a Terminator, through the fire, until its red glowing eyes are in extreme close-up, accompanied by the thematic five rapid drumbeatsThe action changes to a truck stop in the middle of the night The wind scatters trash strewn around several trucks parked in the lot Electric charges fill the air, jumping among several trucks Out of nowhere, a brightly-lit orb appears, cutting out parts from the ground and a nearby truck The orb dissolves, leaving a crouching, naked man in its place As the electrical charges slowly fade, the Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger rises to its feet It has the same appearance as the one that got sent through time in The Terminator to kill Sarah Connor We see its red point-of-view processing screen as it approaches the Corral, a biker bar across the street from the truck stop, inspects the motorcycles in front of it, and entersThe bikers inside watch with a mixture of astonishment and amusement as the naked Terminator calmly walks among them, inspecting every male customer on the way It even attracts a couple of looks from one of the waitresses It stops in front of a cigar-smoking biker as it determines that the man's clothes are a match to its body size The Terminator calmly tells him that it needs his clothes, boots, and motorcycle, causing much hilarity among the other customers The cigar man tells it that it forgot to say please and blows smoke in the Terminator's face He puts out his cigar on Terminator's bare chest, only to be surprised that the pain doesn't seem to bother it The Terminator grabs the man's hand and twists his arm Another biker hits the Terminator in the head with a pool cue he's hurled through the window for his trouble The cigar biker is thrown into the kitchen and lands on the hot stove, burning his hands A

activity going on around him as he travels down the hall holding a clipboard, acting like just another employee as he steals a Goodhew ambulanceAt a construction parts dealer, one of Neil's associates, Chris Shiherlis Val Kilmer, purchases some explosive charges, showing a valid driver's license, and pays in cash when the clerk asks him how he wants to payMeanwhile, Lieutenant Vincent Hanna Al Pacino, a robbery-homicide detective for the Los Angeles Police Department, after having sex with his wife Justine Diane Verona, leaves for work Just after he leaves, his 15-year-old stepdaughter, Lauren Natalie Portman, suffers a slight breakdown in front of her mother while she's preparing to meet her fatherThis same day, Neil, Shiherlis, and three other men, Trejo Danny Trejo, Waingro Kevin Gage, and Michael Cheritto Tom Sizemore, carry out the robbery of a Gage armored car Neil and Shiherlis, wearing paramedic uniforms, station the stolen ambulance on Venice Boulevard just east of the Interstate 10Interstate 110 overpass While this happens, Waingro is picked up at a caf by Cheritto in a stolen green big rig tow truck As they drive towards the scheduled ambush point, Waingro tries to make conversation with Cheritto, who merely asks for him to shut up Waingro is quite agitated at the order They park their truck underneath the highway at a 90 degree angle to the street Trejo tails the armored car as it leaves the depot and radios in its location as it gets closer to themWhen Trejo radios back that the armored car is 300 yards away, Neil, Shiherlis, Cheritto and Waingro slip on hockey goalie masks in a deleted scene shown to have been purchased by Cheritto that conceal their faces They then move their vehicles into position Neil puts the ambulance in drive, activates the lights and siren, and starts to execute a three-point turn to block the armored car as it approaches from the west on Venice Boulevard, while Cheritto floors the gas pedal of the tow truck The armored car stops, its path obstructed by Neil The two guards in the back are reading their newspapers, oblivious to what is about to happen As he waits, the driver looks left and his eyes go wide when he sees the tow truck bearing down on him The tow truck rams the armored car at full speed, and the impact partially caves in the truck's grille, while the armored car turns over and slides 50 feet on its passenger side into a car dealership parking lotAs the dust settles, the robbers climb out of their vehicles, draw assault rifles and pistols, and take up positions around the overturned car as one of the guards makes a radio call for help Hearing a dispatch call for a 211 armed robbery on his police scanner, Trejo radios to the others that they have three minutes, and Neil starts a stopwatch Shiherlis sets off an explosive charge to blow open the back doors Neil and Cheritto then climb into the armored car and drag the three guards out, and hand them over to Waingro, who holds the guards at bay on the sidewalk with a pistol While Neil and Cheritto cover the street, Trejo runs a spike strip across the street to stop any police that pursue them, and Shiherlis searches the truck for several envelopes When Neil yells that they have eighty seconds remaining on the clock, Waingro suddenly gets aggressive and pistol-whips the first guard, who can't hear Waingro's order to back up due to his hearing loss as a result of Shiherlis's explosivesOnce Shiherlis has found the specific envelope the crew is after, he exits the back of the truck, and the men begin to head back to the ambulance and move out Waingro mutters something about the guard challenging him and suddenly shoots the first guard in the face at point-blank range,"

observe and collect specimens One of them wanders some distance away, when strange lights and sounds cause him to hide The group of men are led by one who has a jingling set of keys attached to a belt loop Scared, the creature takes of running, with the men in pursuit The creature attempts to get back to his spaceship, but it leaves without him Eventually, it makes its way down an embankment into the suburban housing development belowIn one house, a young boy named Elliot is sent out to pick up a pizza being delivered for his brother Michael and his friends Elliot is about to return inside when a strange noise in the backyard catches his ears Elliot traces the noise to a gardening shed in the backyard Elliot throws a baseball into the shed, and is scared when something in the shed throws it back out Elliot rushes inside to tell everyone, and they all come out to investigate, but find nothing in the shed, except for some strange prints, which Michael assumes must belong to some type of coyote from the nearby woodsLater that evening, Elliot hears some noise outside in the backyard, and goes outside He encounters a strange creature that scares the both of them The creature quickly leaves the backyard and through a nearby gate that leads into the woodsThe next day, Elliot goes out on his bike to the forest, taking a bag of Reese Pieces with him, hoping to find the creature he saw He soon sees the man with the keys on his belt loop, and quickly leaves the forested areaThat evening, Elliot gets into an argument with his family, when it seems that noone will believe him Elliot claims that his Dad would believe him As their Mother has just been through a messy divorce, this causes her feelings to be hurt, with Michael angrily chastising his brother for being cruelLater that evening, Elliot stays outside, where this time, the creature comes right up to him, and returns some of the Reeses Pieces that were in the forest Elliot then lures the creature into the house and up to his room When he finally sees the creature in full, it is a strange brown-colored being that is like nothing he's ever seen beforeElliot fakes having a fever the next day to stay home from school During the day, he acclimates himself to the creature, and tells him his name, as well as shows him different things around the house Later that evening, Elliot shows the creature to Michael and their younger sister Gertie, who both promise not to tell anyone about himThey soon surmise that this thing must in some way be an alien, and get him to try and explain where he's from Instead, the creature displays its powers, which cause several spheres to levitate and rotate like the planets in the solar system Gertie also gives the alien a potted plant with dying flowers,which the alien revivesElliot has the creature hide in his closet the next day, as everyone heads off to school While everyone is away, the alien gets out and into the fridge, raiding the food and drinking several beers, before watching TV Unknown to Elliot, the alien has formed a mental bond with him, and these feelings carry on over to his Science Class, where Elliot finds himself setting loose a number of frogs for a dissection project, as well as kissing a girl in classAfter Elliot returns home that evening, he finds that Gertie has helped teach the alien to talk, and Elliot then decides to name the alien ET ET then attempts to explain that he intends to build a machine to communicate with his home planet, so they can come to get himLater that evening, Elliot and Michael go through the garage looking for items to use Michael notes that ET doesn't look so good, to which Elliot explains that they are fine Unknown to the two of them, a van monitoring outside has picked up

very simple-minded and has lived in the house his entire life, tending the garden, with virtually no contact with the outside world His cultural and social education is derived entirely from what he watches on the television sets provided by the Old Man, who raised him The only other person in his life is Louise, the maid who cooks his meals and looks upon him as nothing more than a child who has failed to grow up When his benefactor dies, Chance is visited by attorneys handling the estate Chance tells them that he has lived his whole life inside the house He was apparently abandoned as a baby and left in a basket outside the front door where the Old Man lived, who took him in and raised him The lawyers force him to leave the townhouse and he discovers the outside world for the first timeChance wanders aimlessly through a wintry and busy Washington dressed in conservative, old-fashioned business attire, a homburg hat, suitcase, umbrella and a television remote from his former home Although finely-tailored many years ago, his clothes are of the style which has now come back into fashion, and so others presume he is an expensively well-dressed man of meansThat evening, as he wanders, Chance happens upon a TV store He sees his own image in one of the TVs captured by a camera in the shop window While watching himself he backs into the street and is struck by a car owned by Ben Rand Melvyn Douglas, a wealthy businessman Rand's wife Eve Shirley MacLaine, who is inside the limo, invites Chance to their home to recover from his injured leg After being offered alcohol for the first time in his life, Chance coughs after he is asked his name He says, Chance the Gardener, but due to his cough those listening interpret his name to be Chauncey GardinerDuring dinner at the Rands' home, Chance describes the attorneys coming to his former house and shutting it down where he lived his whole life after the death of the Old Man Judging by his appearance and overall demeanor, Ben Rand automatically assumes that Chauncey is an upper class, well-to-do, highly-educated business man Although Chance is really describing being kicked out of the home where he tended to the garden after the death of his legal guardian, Ben Rand perceives it as attorneys shutting down Chance's business because of financial problems after the death of his long-term boss and mentor the Old ManBen even assumes it must have been caused by kid lawyers from the SEC, obviously attributing it to have occurred at a higher, more sophisticated level than a taxIRS problem, as most persons would likely have assumed Sympathizing with him, Ben Rand takes Chance under his wing Chance's personal style and seemingly conservative and insightful ways embody many qualities that Ben admires His simplistic, serious-sounding utterances, which mostly concern the garden, are interpreted by virtually everyone as allegorical statements of deep wisdom and knowledge regarding business matters and the current state of the economy in AmericaBen Rand is also the confidant and adviser of the US President Jack Warden, whom he introduces to Chauncey Chance's remarks about how the garden changes with the seasons are interpreted by the President as economic and political advice, relating to his concerns about the mid-term unpopularity that many administrations face while in office Chance, as Chauncey Gardiner, quickly rises to national public attention He becomes a media celebrity and appears on a national television talk show He rapidly joins the A-list of the most wanted in Washington society Public opinion polls start to reflect just how much his simple brand of wisdom resonates with the jaded American public At an upscale Washington cocktail lounge, two important, older, well-dressed men are discussing Chauncey one says to the other, there is a rumor he holds degrees in medicine as well"

towing a new tan Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera through a sub-freezing blizzard to a small inn in Fargo, North Dakota It is 830 pm on a cold night in January 1987 When the driver goes inside, we see that it is Jerry Lundegaard William H Macy, and he uses the false name 'Jerry Anderson' to check in He then goes to the inn's barrestaurant to have a meeting with two menJerry has obviously never met them before The short, bug-eyed, dark-haired, annoyed, talkative one, Carl Showalter Steve Buscemi, tells him that Shep Proudfoot, a mutual acquaintance of theirs who set up the meeting, had said Jerry would be there at 730 rather than 830 The other man, a tall, blond Swede named Gaear Grimsrud Peter Stormare, sits silently and smokes They discuss the tan Ciera as part of a payment to them from Jerry, plus 40,000 Apparently, Jerry has hired the men to kidnap his wife in order to get a ransom from his wife's father Jerry is a fast talker and doesn't want to say much about why he needs the money, but he reveals that his father-in-law is rich and that he plans on asking for 80,000 and keeping the other half for himself Carl and Gaear accept the dealThe next day, Jerry returns to his home in Minneapolis, Minnesota and his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson Harve Presnell, is sitting on the couch watching TV, visiting that night for supper They all eat dinner, and Jerry and his wife Jean's young teenage son, Scotty Tony Denman, leaves early to go to McDonald's Jerry and Wade start to argue about this and that Jerry seems to spoil Scotty and does not inflict much disipline To get out of the conversation, Jerry changes the subject by bringing up a deal he had apparently suggested earlier to Wade, in which he's asking for a loan of 750,000 to build a 40-acre parking lot in Wayzata Wade tells Jerry that his associate, Stan Grossman, usually looks at those kinds of deals before he does Jerry nervously urges him to accept it, saying he and his family need the money soon Wade, who appears to have a condescending attitude toward Jerry, tells him that Jean and Scotty will never have to worry about money but does not mention Jerry's nameAnother day later, Carl and Gaear are driving the Cutlass Ciera towards Minneapolis Gaear tells Carl he wants to stop at pancakes house, and Carl complains that they just had pancakes for breakfast Gaear looks at him and tells him coldly they will stop at pancakes house Carl agrees, somewhat reluctantly, they will stop in Brainerd, get pancakes, and get laidBack in Minneapolis, Jerry is the executive sales manager at the car lot Wade owns, a job which fits Jerry's talkative, weasely manner He's arguing with a couple about the TruCoat sealant on the couple's new car, and now Jerry is clearly over-charging them for it when they had said they didn't want it Jerry says he will talk to his manager about it, and leaves the room to have a conversation with another salesman about hockey tickets He comes back and lies to the couple by stating that his manager has approved a discount on the TruCoat, and the husband agrees but profanely accuses Jerry of being a liarThe story goes back briefly to a motel room at the Blue Ox, a motel in Brainerd that evening Gaear and Carl are having enthusiastic sex with two women on separate beds in the same roomThe next morning at the Lundegaards', Jean Kristin Rudrd and Scotty are having an argument about his grades The phone rings, and it's Wade calling for Jerry Wade tells him that Stan Grossman has looked at the parking lot deal and he says it's pretty sweet Jerry tries to restrain his excitement, as he apparently had thought Wade wouldn't want to go through with it They schedule a meeting for 230that afternoonJerry is optimistic about the future meeting with Wade, and is now

play on which the black and white film is based, invited Marlon Brando, the male lead, and Kim Hunter and Karl Malden, his supporting cast, to repeat their Broadway triumphs in the film remakeBrando plays Stanley, a poor boy who grew up tainted by ethnic slurs, made financially stable by the fortunes of the second world war He does well as a blue collar travelling salesman, moves to New Orleans and marries Stella Hunter, daughter of an Aristocratic MIssissippi family anxious to escape the wars invitable destruction of her family's land, wealth, property and social status Stanley has never met his sister-in-law Blanche, the female lead of the play ,Vivien Leigh in the movie remake Blanche arranges a visit to see her sister in New Orleans and shows up on Stanley's doorstop obviously annoyed that there is neither a guest bedroom for herself nor a master bedroom for her sister and brother-in-law, in their cramped, dingy apartment in a bustling quarter of the city The tensions of wartime emergency cohabitation of family members somehow forced to move in with each other in tight, cramped quarters because of the fortunes of war are noted when it is obvious that Blanche and Stanley immediately get on each others' nerves, especially when Blanche, who passes herself off as the only Aristocrat in her new neighborhood, is the only one in her new neighborhood who actually resorts to tough bar language and ethnic slurs in passing conversation This becomes no ordinary domestic quarrel when their tensions escalate beyond a war of words to hurtful, spiteful deeds and then to climatic physical violence Hollywood icons Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh are given close, tight photography in their lengthy scenes of escalating conflict, played with such deep insight and such technical brilliance that the audience is given pause, from moment to moment to decide whether one really has a point and the other should really be apprehended by the authorities Stanley first wants to know why Blanche seems to be planning to stay for life and what happened to his wife's claim on the family fortune, land, property and social status Blanche wants Stanley to give up his weekly card game and his weekly bowling tournament with his friends including Mitch Malden, to stay at home always sweating in his dirtied work clothes because he will have no place to wash and change with a lady in his house, sitting silent like a statue, until he decides it is time to just turn his paycheck over to Stella and move out so Blanche can rule the roostWhen Blanche attracts the attention of lonely Mitch who sees the remnants of her Aristocratic upbringing, Stanley investigates, through a friend travelling in Mississippi, why his emotionally disturbed, alcoholic, child molesting sister-in-law was fired from her job and kicked out of her boarding house A telling interlude has Stanley striking Stella for interfering with his treatment of Blanche She escapes to the upstairs apartment of her landlady Peg Hillias, but is so dependent upon Stanley that she returns to him when he goes into the yard and calls for her to come back Things do not go well for Blanche when Stella goes to the hospital to give birth to her child just after a teenage boy accuses her of making improper advances when he came to her door to collect money for Stanley's periodical subscription and Mitch dumps her There is surrealistic moment, to be individually sorted out by each viewer, when Blanche insists she is going to cut up Stanley's face with the jagged edges of a broken liquor bottle and then insists he is going to rape her The play and the movie cuts from the blackout to a scene some time later when Stella is putting her baby to sleep in the front yard, Stanley is having his card game over, and authorities arrive from the local mental institution to put Blanche away for lifeThe landlady calls Stella to the bathroom, where Blanche is soaking up her cares in another hot water tub"

named Clopin performs puppet shows for children Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedralTwenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris and possibly all over France, so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrestedThe man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods, she ran Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed herThe baby started to cry When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster the baby is never shown He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had done--as much as if the statues of the cathedral itself were alive and aware of what they just witnessed Being fearful for his salvation, Claude Frollo asked what he needed to do, and the Archdeacon told him to raise the child as if he were his own He reluctantly agreed, but only on the condition that the child lived up in the bell-towers of Notre Dame, away from public view He wondered to himself if the child might be of use to him in the futureClopin reveals the child's name given by Frollo Quasimodo, signifying in Latin half-formed not a literal translation Sometimes he's called Quasi for short He concludes his tale about a man and a monster by saying, 'Now here is a riddle to guess if you can,' sing the bells of Notre Dame 'Who is the monster, and who is the man' Meanwhile, the now adult Quasimodo walks out onto a balcony at the base of the bell-towers of Notre Dame, and he is shown to be severely deformed, the most prominent feature being his hunched back After a brief moment where he helps a young bird learn to fly, he envies the bird and goes back in to his home inside one of the bell-towers It is filled with old statues a stained-glass mobile and wooden models made by Quasi of the Notre Dame Cathedral, houses, and various citizens of Paris He speaks with three stone gargoyles named Victor, Hugo, and LaVerne who are presumed to be real and alive in this synopsis it can be argued that they are part of Quasi's imagination, but there are certain scenes which imply they are more than that, as well as scenes in the Direct-to-Video sequel He laments that Frollo will not allow him to attend the Festival or Feast of Fools later that day, or even leave the bell towers on any other day, but the gargoyles convince him to go out in disguiseBefore he can enact his plan, Frollo arrives with Quasi's lunch, and the gargoyles revert to inanimate stone they only come alive when Quasi's alone While going over his alphabet lessons, Quasimodo accidentally reveals"

a run-down motel room and being raised by her neglectful, drug-addicted mother, Ramona Amanda Plummer, who supports them by collecting welfare and working as a prostitute Ramona's current boyfriend, Larry Michael T Weiss spends his days getting high by smoking crack and sexually abusing Vanessa When the police bust Ramona for hooking on a nearby corner, they take Larry and Ramona away to prison and leave Vanessa with foster care as an option When her social worker comes to take her away, Vanessa handcuffs her to a bed and makes off with her car Before leaving the neighborhood, Vanessa stops to talk to her boyfriend Chopper Bokeem Woodbine to tell him that she is leaving town to search for the only family member she knows of, a distant grandmother who lives in Northern California and who doesn't even know Vanessa exists Chopper gives Vanessa his gun and tells her to pawn it for cash As soon as Vanessa drives off and is out of sight, thugs drive by and shoot the now-defenseless Chopper deadThe stolen car that Vanessa is driving breaks down on the local Interstate I-5 freeway just outside Los Angeles, and a man in an SUV pulls over to help her He identifies himself as Bob Wolverton Kiefer Sutherland, and tells Vanessa that the car is not driveable anymore He offers to give Vanessa a ride with him, and she goes with him in his vehicleAfter driving a while, Bob gets Vanessa to open up to him and tell him about her life, and she tells him about her broken home, her mother's drug abuse and prostitution, the violence and abuse that she has encountered in various foster homes, and the sexual abusiveness of Larry At one point, Vanessa shows Bob a photo she keeps in her wallet of her biological father The photo used is actually a picture of mass murderer Richard SpeckAfter buying her dinner at a roadside restaurant, and pretending to engage her in a theraputic session during the drive, Bob reveals himself to be a notorious serial killer, known by the press as the I-5 Killer who has been haunting the freeway and killing innocent young women who walk along itVanessa is afraid, but she also becomes infuriated at him for violating the trust she put in him by telling him her life story, and Bob finds that she is not easily intimidated Furthermore, Vanessa easily identifies the hypocrisy that Bob reveals when he identifies Vanessa and his other victims as garbage people You act like you're on some kind of mission, she tells him, but you really just wanna get off in a sex type way The fact that Vanessa is so logical and intelligent, despite her limited vocabulary and background, enrages Bob, especially when Vanessa is more disgusted than afraid when he reveals that he wants to perform sex acts on her body after he kills herUsing her quick wit, she is able to attack Bob and turn the tables on him by diving into the back seat and retrieving Chopper's gun She forces Bob at gunpoint to pull off of the freeway into a desolate area, where she explains that Bob has proved to her that he is rotten and will only continue to murder women if she does not stop him Vanessa shoots Bob in the face, and is horrified when she must pull the trigger over and over in order to kill him When she thinks he is finally dead, she takes his wallet and walks to a nearby diner, where the blood all over her clothes alerts everybody that something is wrong She is easily apprehended minutes later by the police, who take her into custody Meanwhile, Bob, who is not dead after all, manages to get to a hospital and get help for his injuriesAt a local police station, Vanessa is questioned by two policemen, Mike Breer Wolfgang Bodison and Garnet Wallace Dan Hedaya At first, Vanessa is cooperative and freely admits to shooting Bob, but she is dismayed to

vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death Most puzzling are his last moments clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word rosebud Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane He assigns a reporter called Thompson William Alland to investigate RosebudThompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane Dorothy Comingore, the tycoon's ex-wife she's drunk and won't speak to him Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr Thatcher George Coulouris, Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr remarked, what the kid needs is a good thrashing Mrs Kane responded, That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr Kane was abusive 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out betterYears later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer Don't sell it, he famously wrote to Thatcher I think it would be fun to run a newspaper -- a statement that exasperates Thatcher greatly A scene where Thatcher visited Kane at the Inquirer to talk him out of throwing so much money away on low-class journalism showed Kane using the paper to instigate the Spanish-American War But in the same scene Kane earnestly told Thatcher that he wanted to use journalism to protect the interests of ordinary peopleNext, Thompson interviews Bernstein Everett Sloane, the general manager of Kane's newspaper empire In further flashbacks, Bernstein recalls how he, Kane, and Kane's college friend Jedediah Leland Joseph Cotten took over the stuffy, unprofitable Inquirer and transformed it into a money-maker, eventually hiring the staff of the rival New York ChronicleAt Bernstein's urging, Thompson seeks out Leland, who recounts the story of Kane's first marriage to Emily Norton, Ruth Warrick and makes some negative comments about his one-time friend's character Charlie was never brutal, he just did brutal things He married for love -- that's why he did everything That's why he went into politics It seems we weren't enough He wanted all the voters to love him, too All he really wanted out of life was love That's Charlie's story -- it's the story of how he lost it You see, he just didn't have any to give He never believed in anything except Charlie KaneLeland goes on to describe Kane's second marriage, to Susan Alexander Kane started seeing her while he was still married to Emily, during his campaign for governor He ran on an anti-corruption platform, promising to investigate and bring down his opponent, political boss Jim Gettys Ray Collins Gettys found out about Susan and threatened to

after several years of political unrest in Scotland, the land is open to an invasion from the south King Edward I of England Patrick McGoohan has decided to conquer Scotland After invading Scotland and winning the war by 1280 AD, Edward known as 'Longshanks' grants areas of land in Scotland to his nobility which they are to rule, along with the traditional privileges One of the privileges granted to English lords ruling Scotland was Primae Noctis, the right for the lord to take a newly married Scottish woman into his bed and spend the wedding night with the bride Longshanks' plan is to breed out the population of ScotlandIn the northern Scottish town of Lanark, a young boy named William Wallace, follows his father and brother to a meeting of Scottish nobles, arranged by Longshanks himself When Wallace Senior and his older son arrive at the meeting place, they see that the Scots have all been hanged, along with their servants William also sees the hanging corpses and panics when his father finds himWallace Senior attends another meeting where it's decided that they will go to war with the English William wishes to accompany his father and brother, however, his father tells him to stay home and mind the farm A few days later, Campbell Senior, William's best friend's Hamish father arrives at the farm William's father is killed in battle, as was his brother Following the funeral, William is given a thistle by a young girl William's uncle, Argyle, arrives on horseback and tells William that he'll be leaving home with him That night William and Argyle listen to bagpipers play a tribute for William's dead family Argyle tells William that the pipes are outlawed He also sees William's interest in his sword and tells William that he'll give him a traditional education and teach him how to fight laterTen years later, the adult William Wallace Mel Gibson returns home to his father's farm He reconnects with his old friend Hamish At a community wedding, Wallace sees the local magistrate take the bride for himself according to primae noctis Wallace also falls in love with his childhood sweetheart Murron MacClannough Catherine McCormack, the young girl who gave him the thistle at his father's funeral, and they marry in secret so that she does not have to spend a night in the bed of the English lordThe Scots continue to live under the iron fist of Longshanks' cruel laws Wallace intends on living as a farmer and avoiding involvement in the ongoing troubles in Scotland When an English soldier tries to rape Murron, Wallace fights off several soldiers and the two attempt to flee, but the village sheriff captures Murron and publicly executes her by slitting her throat, proclaiming an assault on one of the King's soldiers is the same as an assault on the King himself In retribution, Wallace returns to the village, seemingly ready to surrender He attacks his captors and joins several villagers as they slaughter the English garrison Wallace himself brutally executes the sheriff in the same manner that he executed MurronFollowing their triumph, Wallace is compelled to fight against the English who have taken over his homeland and enslaved himself and his countrymen and women In response to Wallace's exploits, the commoners of Scotland rise in revolt against England As his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans volunteer to join Wallace's militia Wallace leads his army through a series of successful battles against the English, including the Battle of Stirling Bridge September 11, 1297 where Wallace's Scots are outnumbered by the English armyAfterward, the victourious Scots invade northern England and sack of the city of York and kill its lord, the nephew of Longshanks himself During his campaign, Wallace seeks the assistance of young Robert the Bruce Angus MacFayden, son of the leper noble Robert the Elder Ian Bannen and the chief contender for the Scottish crown However, Robert is dominated

lounge, and ends up having a one-night-stand with her When he attempts to further the relationship, Kirina implies that she has no future and thanks him for a wonderful night of pleasure and love Dejected and somewhat confused, Paul reluctantly leaves her to be alone as she requestsSoon after the gaijin leaves her suite, however, she is approached by Kinjo John Lone and two other men dressed as ninja Kirina shows no fear and explains that she has accepted her fate Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins, is impressed by the woman's courage and grants her final wish by showing her his face Paul, who had left with the wrong room key, returns and, upon seeing the situation, hides in the foyer while calling the police When Kinjo decapitates Kirina after telling her that she's the first person outside of the cult ever to see his face, Paul first tries to come to her defense, alerting the three ninjas to his presence and then tries to flee Enraged that someone else has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shurkien, and slash his throat, leaving him for deadPaul awakes in a hospital room, where he is told that the wound will heal, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police He is soon approached by a man named Takeda Yoshio Harada, who is an expert on the cult, and Kinjo in particular Paul later discovers that Takeda is the last in a long line of samurai and has his own score to settle with Kinjo After the ninja attempt to murder Paul at the hospital, killing six police officers in the process Takeda and his wife Mieko Yoko Shimada decide to take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away In leaving the city, however, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out This leads to a battle on a bullet train in which several passenger cars worth of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninja Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, only to learn that Kinjo was not among them The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving the ninja master personal motivation to kill Paul and TakedaWhile on the island, Paul spends much time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a new sword for Takeda he had furiously broken his own sword following the train fight when police confiscated it as evidence, and the old man teaches him about both smithing and swordsmanship Mieko explains to him the history of the two clans' conflict as well as the samurai concepts of courage and honor Mieko is sympathetic toward the gentle and compassionate Paul, the polar opposite of her moody and somewhat-deranged husband, although she remains fiercely loyal to TakedaMeanwhile, Kinjo decides to find out who hired his clan to murder Kirina The man he finds James Saito is a powerful Yakuza figure who bought Kirina from her father, then ordered her death when she left him after years of servitude Kinjo, disgusted that he killed an innocent woman over such a petty grievance, kills the manThree weeks later, Takeda's new sword is ready, and Paul's injuries have healed considerably When Paul announces that he wants to leave the island and return home to New York, Takeda has him imprisoned and sends a message to Kinjo telling him Paul's whereabouts Takeda's inexperienced samurai are overwhelmed by the hordes of ninja who arrive on the island, but Takeda finally gets the duel with Kinjo that he has wanted all along Kinjo stabs Takeda through the torso Takeda in turn manages to stab Kinjo in the leg, but soon diesAs Kinjo is about to kill a helpless Mieko he is caught off-guard by Paul, whom Oshima had released on Mieko's instructions Paul stabs Kinjo in the arm, but now finds himself face-to-face with his would-be killer, armed with only a sword he

Celeste Holm, and one of the brightest stars of Broadway, the incomparable Margo Channing Bette Davis All look upon Miss Harrington with a mixture of distaste and disgust on their faces, while off to the side sits the well known and often reviled theater critic Addison DeWitt George Sanders, who, with a bemused look on his face, begins to recount Eve's recent past He, better than anyone else, knows all about EveNot so long ago, Eve was just a star-struck young woman, waiting outside the stage door night after night, hoping to catch a glimpse of her idol Margo Channing Finally noticed and

town of Los Robles, newlyweds Mike and Susan Vargas Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh witness a car bomb explosion in which Rudy Linnekar, a local construction magnate, and his female companion are killedSuspecting that the bomb was planted on the Mexican side of the border and may be the work of the Grandi narcotics ring, Vargas, the Mexican head of the Pan-American Narcotics Commission, offers his assistance to the Los Robles officials investigating the case The lead detective, the obese and lumbering Capt Hank Quinlan Orson Welles, rudely rebuffs Vargas' offer However, Quinlan's partner, the loyal Sgt Pete Menzies Joseph Calleia, and Adair, a district attorney Ray Collins, apologize for Quinlan's behavior and invite Vargas to observe their investigation because of his status as a highly placed Mexican government officialIn the meantime, a group of young Mexican men working for Uncle Joe Grandi Akim Tamiroff, a small-time crime boss with a bad toupee, bring Susan, an American, to Grandi's headquarters in a sleazy hotel Grandi warns Susan of dire consequences if her husband continues his prosecution of Grandi's brother, an imprisoned drug dealer awaiting trial in Mexico, but Susan is unimpressedWhile investigating the case on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan visits the tawdry brothel run by Tanya, a former lover Marlene Dietrich, and the place fills him with nostalgic yearnings Upon learning of Susan's encounter with Grandi, Vargas decides that she will be safer stashed in a motel on the American side of the border while he continues working on the Linnekar case However, unknown to Vargas, the motel is owned by Grandi, staffed by a very nervous night clerk Dennis Weaver, in the middle of the desertQuinlan soon tracks down a suspect, a Mexican shoe clerk who was having an affair with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia Joanna Moore, and later married her in a secret ceremony Sanchez Victor Millan claims he is innocent and appeals to Vargas for help After a prolonged search, Quinlan declares that Menzies has found damning evidence of Sanchez's guilt concealed in a shoe box Vargas, who had earlier seen that the box was empty, accuses Quinlan of planting dynamite in the box to frame SanchezGrandi approaches Quinlan to suggest that they work together to ruin Vargas and after Quinlan has downed several drinks at Grandi's prodding, they plot to destroy Vargas professionally and personally by framing Susan Grandi's gang of young hoodlums, led by a sadistic woman clad in black leather Mercedes McCambridge, take over the motel and accost the terrified Susan, who is shot up with drugs and then transported to a room in Grandi's hotelWhen Vargas meets with Police Chief Gould and District Attorney Adair to discuss his suspicions about Quinlan, the faithful Menzies doggedly tracks down his partner to inform him of the meeting Quinlan storms in on the meeting and, furious that Gould is not defending him, makes a show of throwing down his badge Uncomfortable with the fact that Vargas is an outsider making accusations against a star detective, Gould and Adair placate Quinlan by telling Vargas to stay out of police business Al Schwartz, a young assistant DA, stands by Vargas and secretly gains him access to Quinlan's case files, which strongly suggest that Quinlan, tortured by the fact that he was unable to find enough evidence to convict the suspect who strangled his wife, has been framing suspects for years Unable to accept that his partner and best friend is crooked, Menzies attempts to defend QuinlanUnable to reach Susan by phone, Vargas finally makes it to the motel to find the night clerk sitting in the dark and seemingly speechless with fear To Vargas' horror, all that remains in Susan's room are the stench of marijuana smoke and the debris of a wild partyMeanwhile, Quinlan arrives at Grandi's hotel and enters the room where Susan lies unconscious, the smell of marijuana clinging to the clothing

August, 1914 and, with the construction of a continuous line of fortified trenches stretching from Switzerland to the English Channel, a costly military stalemate set in By 1916, successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousandsGeneral George Broulard Adolphe Menjou, an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters a magnificent chateau of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau George Macready, to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill' Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill After explaining to Broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than all the stars and decorations in France, the ambitious Mireau concludes that an attack on the Anthill just might workMireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer, Major Saint-Auban Richard Anderson The general stops to ask several soldiers who later become major characters the question, Ready to kill more Germans When one soldier Fred Bell fails to answer, merely staring straight ahead, his comrades reply that the soldier is suffering from shell shock Mireau says there is no such thing as shell shock When the general enquires about whether the soldier has a wife, the soldier replies that he'll never see her again since he's certain to be killed, to which Mireau scolds the soldier for acting like a coward When the soldier replies that he is a coward, Mireau flies into a rage and strikes the soldier across the face, yelling that he wants this little baby transferred out of the regiment As they continue through the trenches, Maj Saint-Auban says that the general was right to do what he did and adds that he thinks that the high morale of the 701st Regiment is the direct result of the general's inspections, which Mireau denies, saying that their fighting spirit was just born in themThe commander of the 701st Regiment, Colonel Dax Kirk Douglas, is greeted in his headquarters bunker by Mireau When Maj Saint-Auban makes a disparaging remark about the enlisted men, Dax takes offense and Mireau asks the major to leave them alone to discuss the coming assault Dax is informed by Mireau of his plan to launch an attack on the Anthill, for which Dax shows little enthusiasm Mireau criticizes Dax's lack of enthusiasm and threatens to have him relieved of command if he does not agree to his plan Not wishing to be taken away from my men, the colonel reluctantly agrees that the 701st Regiment will attempt to take the AnthillThat night, a patrol is ordered to be sent out to reconnoiter no-man's land, the space between the opposing trenches Corporal Paris Ralph Meeker is among the two men chosen to accompany the half-drunk Lieutenant Roget Wayne Morris on this patrol Cpl Paris' fellow soldier remarks that the corporal does seem to like the lieutenant, to which Cpl Paris replies that he knew Roget before the war and didn't have much respect for him then either Lt Roget, having sought to bolster his courage with alcohol, leads the patrol through the barbed wire, water-filled shell holes, and general wreckage that is no-man's land When they come to a halt, Lt Roget orders the third member of the patrol to scout forward on his own, against the objections of Cpl

angel, to help a man in distress It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up They are receiving prayers from mortals, like Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy George Bailey James Stewart is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him They select Clarence Henry Travers, a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds The bulk of the movie is a replaying, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, of George's life, so that Clarence will understand GeorgeGeorge Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's Todd Karns life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr Gower's HB Warner drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch Donna Reed and Violet Bick Gloria Grahame, who seem to be competing for his noticeGeorge's father Samuel S Hinds, with a small staff including Uncle Billy Thomas Mitchell, run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter Lionel Barrymore Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments, and would like to put Bailey's company out of businessGeorge wants to begin his adventures after going to college While he has enormous respect for his father and what he is doing to help people, he definitely does not want to follow in his father's footsteps at the Building and Loan But one thing after another thwarts his plansGeorge went to work at the Building and Loan for a few years after graduating from high school, with the expectation that Harry would take this over when he graduated, and George would go on a European tour and then go to college But his father has a fatal stroke, and George has to take over the BL for a few months, giving up the European tour Then Potter attempts to liquidate the BL, the only thing that can stop it is for George himself to take it over So he gives up college, and gives his college money to Harry The plan at that point was that, after Harry graduates, he will take over the BL, and George will go to college But Harry returns from college having married Ruth Dakin, and Ruth's father has offered him a job in upstate New York So George has no choice but to stay with the BLGeorge marries Mary Hatch after a difficult introduction--he mistakenly thinks Mary is in love with his lifelong rival Sam Wainwright Frank Albertson They are about to go on their honeymoon with 2000 they have saved up But a banking crisis occurs Potter has taken over the bank that guarantees the BL's loans, and has called in the loans The customers are in a panic and are tempted to go over to Potter's bank The only way George can save the situation is to provide for the customers' needs

Margot Kidder, fresh from the success of Superman who bought a charming Dutch Colonial home in Amityville, on the coast of Long Island NY, in 1975 A sign in front of the house gives its name as High HopesThe film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977 Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to himThe home features the Dutch gambrel barn-shaped roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof These are illuminated to look like the home's eyes Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly closeIt is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11131974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz's, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of 80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth 120,000Despite full disclosure of the home's past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home Father Delaney Rod Steiger encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the homeIn his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he's seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdownIt is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will, and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state Presubably, his mind is goneGeorge begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter's 2nd story window The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basementGeorge's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned The business partner's wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house Boy are these vibes ever strong she says at one pointThe Lutz's witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an ooze coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of 1,50000 cash, and Kathy's Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting Kathy observes George's persistant waking at 315 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior familyTheir research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the

stone ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt In the present day, Langford's daughter Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson, a down-on-his-luck linguistics professor, the chance to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the Pyramid of Khufu Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation inside Creek Mountain, Colorado Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the stone ring's coverstones, which read A million years into the sky is Ra Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate Formerly retired Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares it classifiedJackson deduces that the symbols are star constellations that are coordinates for a location within space The sequence is entered into the stargate, creating a wormhole to Abydos, a planet in another galaxy After O'Neil leads a team through the Stargate, they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of vast sand dunes Jackson reveals they cannot dial home because the Stargate coordinates to go back to Earth are missing Some team members stay at the pyramid while Jackson, O'Neil, and others go out and discover a mining village inhabited by humans who assume them to be gods sent by RaJackson realizes that the people speak a dialect of Ancient Egyptian and begins communicating with them The team develops friendships with the people O'Neil with Skaara, and Jackson begins a budding romance with Sha'uri, a daughter of the leader Jackson learns from hieroglyphs in the catacombs how the Egyptian god Ra was actually an alien life form a Goa'uld who enslaved humans with his advanced technology While these humans eventually rebelled and buried the Stargate, some had been taken to Abydos through the Stargate and used to mine the quartzite-like mineral on which all of Ra's technology is based Fearing another rebellion on Abydos, Ra outlawed reading and writing At this point, the team from Earth discovers the coverstone to get back to Earth, but the seventh symbol is eroded awayO'Neil orders the team to return to the pyramid A short time later, a huge spacecraft lands on top of the pyramid Ra's general, Anubis, flanked by warriors in avian themed masks, hunt the soldiers throughout the pyramid's labyrinthine tunnels, dispatching them with blinding speed O'Neil and Jackson are escorted to the throne room, where they meet Ra Ra's guards unmask and are revealed to be human Ra reveals his intention to send the atomic bomb brought by O'Neil, which was to be used to destroy the Stargate to prevent invasion by any threat, back to Earth it is now enhanced with his quartzite-like material to produce cataclysmic results O'Neil attempts to disarm the guards and kill Ra, but relents when Ra uses his children courtiers as human shields Jackson is killed during the altercation O'Neil is thrown into a dungeon with the captured team members, while Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to show the villagers that Ra is their one true godHowever, once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid craft, several young villagers signal to Jackson that they have recovered the team's weapons Jackson then shoots at Ra while the kids create a distraction O'Neil, Jackson, and the rest of the team flee Ra's ship and take shelter in a cave with the boys The next morning, when Skaara draws a picture of the people's victory against Ra, Jackson realizes that part of this drawing depicts the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate three moons over a pyramidO'Neil convinces the locals that their gods are mere mortals and, with their help, O'Neil, Jackson, and the remaining members of the team make it back to the Stargate hoping to deactivate the bomb When the locals begin an open rebellion against Ra's troops, Ra d"

concerned about the situation in Europe and the growing power of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany After searching for a good, tough crime reporter, he appoints Johnny Jones Joel McCrea as a foreign correspondent, under the pen name Huntley HaverstockThe reporter's first assignment is Stephen Fisher Herbert Marshall, leader of the Universal Peace Party, at a party held by Fisher in honor of a diplomat named Van Meer Albert Bassermann On the way to the party, Haverstock sees Van Meer entering the car which is to take him to the party, and runs to interview him Van Meer invites him to ride along At the party, Haverstock meets Fisher's daughter, Carol Laraine Day Van Meer disappears mysteriously Later, Fisher informs the guests that Van Meer, who was supposed to be the guest of honor, will not be attending the party instead he will be at a political conference in AmsterdamAt the conference, Van Meer is shot in front of a large crowd by a man disguised as a photographer Haverstock commandeers a car to follow the assassin's getaway car The car he jumps into happens to have in it Carol and Scott ffolliott George Sanders, another reporter who explains that the capital letter in his surname was dropped in memory of an executed ancestor The group follows the assassin to a windmill in the countrysideWhile Carol and ffolliott go for help, Haverstock searches the windmill and finds a live Van Meer the man who was killed was an impostor The old man is drugged and unable to tell him anything Haverstock is forced to flee when the kidnappers become aware of him By the time the police arrive, the villains have escaped with Van Meer in an airplaneLater, back at Haverstock's hotel room, two spies dressed as policemen arrive to kidnap him When he suspects who they really are, he escapes out the window and into Carol Fisher's roomHaverstock and Carol board a British boat to England, and while a furious storm thunders overhead, he proposes to her In England, the two go to Carol's father's house, where Haverstock sees a man whom he recognizes as one of the men at the windmill He informs Fisher, but Fisher ignores him, saying that he will send a bodyguard to protect him However, the bodyguard Edmund Gwenn repeatedly tries to kill Haverstock instead When the assassin tries to push him off the top of the Westminster Cathedral tower, Haverstock steps aside just in time and the bodyguard plunges to his death insteadHaverstock and ffolliott are convinced that Fisher is a traitor, so the two come up with a plan, with Haverstock taking Carol to the countryside, while ffolliott pretends she has been kidnapped to force Fisher to divulge Van Meer's location However, Haverstock and Carol argue, and she returns to London Just as Fisher is about to fall for ffolliott's bluff, he hears her car pull upffolliott follows Fisher to a hotel where Van Meer is being held Just as Van Meer is being forced to divulge the information the organization wants, ffolliott distracts the interrogators When Haverstock arrives, Fisher and his bodyguards escape, leaving Van Meer behind Van Meer is rushed to the hospital in a comaIn the meantime, England and France have declared war on Germany Then, while the group are on a Short Empire Clipper plane to America, Fisher confesses his deeds to his daughter Despite this, Carol blames Haverstock for not really loving her and only wanting to pursue her father He protests that he was just doing his job as a reporter, but Carol refuses to listen Seconds later, the plane is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean

business meeting at the Oak Room bar of the Plaza Hotel After asking his secretary to phone his mother, he realizes that she won't be able to reach her by telephone, so he will need to send a telegram instead When a hotel pageboy passes by calling for a Mr George Kaplan, Thornhill flags him down, to inquire about sending a telegram Unfortunately, this also draws the attention of two henchmen, names Valerian Adam Williams and Licht Robert Ellenstein, who mistake Roger for Kaplan because from the vantage point they are standing at, he appears to be answering the page As Roger steps into the corridor to send his wire, the henchmen abduct Roger at gunpoint and force him into a waiting carWordlessly, they drive him out of Manhattan to a Long Island country estate displaying the name Townsend at its entrance The car snakes up a long winding driveway to the front entrance A maid lets them in the front door, and Roger is locked inside the library of the mansion Left alone, he finds a newspaper on the desk addressed to Mr Lester Townsend, 169 Baywood, Glen Cove, NYShortly, the library door opens and there enters an urbane English-accented gentleman James Mason, evidently none other than Townsend himself, followed soon after by his personal secretary, Leonard Martin Landau The gentleman addresses his captive as Kaplan, and by his questions, Roger can only assume that the real Kaplan must be some sort of secret agent on this man's trail Roger tries to convince him that his name is Thornhill and has never been anything else, but his skeptic captor will not hear of it To prove his point, the man proceeds to recite the elusive Kaplan's recent itinerary of hotels, cities, and ever-changing hometowns, including Kaplan's present occupancy of room 796 at the Plaza Hotel, and his future stops in the next few days in Chicago and Rapid City, South Dakota To find out how much Kaplan knows about his organization and their current arrangements, he puts Leonard in charge of extracting the information while he withdraws to join Mrs Townsend Josephine Hutchinson and their party guests Leonard unseals a fifth of bourbon taken from a liquor cabinet, and with the aid of Valerian and Licht, he begins to force the whiskey down Roger's throatHaving failed to get any information from their victim, Valerian and Licht place the severely intoxicated Thornhill behind the wheel of a Mercedes on a seaside highway under cover of darkness, planning to guide him off of a cliff to his death Almost unaware of his surroundings, Roger comes sufficiently alert at the last moment to push Valerian out of the car and start driving for himself The two thugs follow him down the winding highway in their own car Roger, on the verge of passing out and plagued with double vision, manages to careen his way down the cliffside highway without hitting anything As he slams on brakes to barely avoid running over a bicyclist, a pursuing police car plows into the rear of the Mercedes, and a third car plows into the rear of the police car Finding themselves overmatched, the two henchmen drive away leaving Roger in police custodyRoger tells everyone at the police station how his captors had tried to kill him, but in his drunken condition no one pays any attention to his bizarre story One of the policemen mentions that the Mercedes Roger was driving was reported stolen Roger phones his mother to let her know he is at the Glen Cove police station for the night In the morning, Roger and his attorney Larrabee Edward Platt face the judge, with Roger's mother, Clara

Woody Strode, Al Mulock approach an isolated train depot two are wearing duster overcoats The men take over the station and settle in to wait for the train When the train finally comes, a nameless harmonica-playing stranger Charles Bronson gets off and asks for someone named Frank They tell him Frank sent them in his place In the ensuing showdown, all four men go down Only the man with the harmonica gets up againThe soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds in the style of John Cage Composer Ennio Morricone uses dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and over all the persistent, annoying squeak of a windmill-powered pump to build tension, punctuate visual jokes, and emphasize the tedium of waiting for the train The scant dialog allows the soundtrack to consume much more of our attention than a score usually doesOn a remote farm called Sweetwater, Brett McBain Frank Wolff and his children are preparing an outdoor wedding feast McBain tells his son Patrick to drive into town to pick up his new mother, who is arriving by train from New Orleans Suddenly shots ring out from the desert, and McBain's daughter Maureen, son Patrick, and McBain himself are slain The youngest McBain, Timmy, runs out of the house to find that his entire family has been destroyed He watches in terrified silence as a group of five gunmen in duster overcoats emerge from the scrub brush When one of the men calls their leader Frank by name, asking what to do with the child, Frank Henry Fonda draws his pistol and slowly takes aim at the last remaining witness With a self-satisfied grin, he pulls the triggerIn the town of Flagstone, McBain's bride Jill Claudia Cardinale steps down from the train to find that no one is there to meet her Giving up hope, she steps through the train station into the bustling new town still being built She hires a carriage to drive her to Sweetwater The farm's name draws laughter from the driver, Sam Paolo Stoppa, who informs her that Sweetwater is a worthless piece of ground, and McBain is crazy for trying to farm itAlong the way, Sam speeds through a group of railroad workers busily laying their damn rails Then he stops at a wayside inntaverntrading post, and Jill follows him inside Her beauty draws the unwelcome attentions of the barman Lionel Stander After a noisy off-screen gun battle, the outlaw Cheyenne Jason Robards enters wearing shackles on his wrists The sounds of a harmonica again reveals the presence of the nameless stranger, who has been watching from a dark corner of the tavern Cheyenne dubs him Harmonica, and he uses Harmonica's gun to force another patron to shoot apart the chain between his wrists Cheyenne's men soon arrive, too late to help him escape the prison guards who now lie dead outside Harmonica notes that the three men he killed earlier were wearing the same duster overcoats as Cheyenne's men, and Cheyenne is annoyed that rivals may be copying his trademark dustersJill and Sam arrive at Sweetwater to find a crowd of somber wedding guests standing around the outdoor tables, now put to use as funeral biers Jill is horrified at the carnage When one of the women bemoans that this should happen to the poor little miss on her wedding day, Jill informs the guests that she and Brett McBain were married a month earlier in New Orleans As the burial comes to an end, the crowd discovers that the torn-off collar of a duster overcoat was found on a nail by the door This marks the massacre as Cheyenne's work The men form a posse and

Robert Thorn Gregory Peck is an American diplomat who hurries to a local hospital where his pregnant wife Lee Remick is going into labor When he gets to the hospital, he is informed that his child was a stillbirth A priest named Father Spiletto Martin Benson then offers him the choice to adopt a baby boy just born at the same time who has no parents Thorn is reluctant to do so but knowing his wife will be devestated by the news of the death of her real child he agrees to the adoptionThe boy is called Damien and moves to England with his mother and father when his father is appointed US ambassador to England When Damien Harvey Stephens is celebrating his fifth birthday party, the family's nanny hangs herself in front of everyone and at the same time, the house is being watched by a rottweiler dog In the background, a news photographer named Keith Jennings David Warner is present taking picturesA few days later, a new nanny, named Mrs Baylock Billie Whitelaw is sent to replace her but it is clear that she is not as she seemsMrs Baylock immediately challenges Kathy Thorn's authority when she is instructed to dress and ready Damien to attend a church wedding with them, but she does as she is told As Thorn leaves the house, he is badgered by Jennings about circumstances around the previous nanny's deathThe Thorns travel to the church one Sunday and Damien becomes more fearful as their car approaches the church He has a violent reaction in which he injures his mother trying to get away The car pulls away hurridly and while the Thorns discuss Damien's reaction and whether he should be examined by a doctor, they realize he has never been sick a day in his lifeLater, in his office, Thorn is visited by a priest, named Father Brennan Patrick Troughton, who claims to have been present during Damien's birth in Rome five years ago He begs Thorn to accept Christ, because only then can he fight the son of the devil The priest is escorted out by security and Jennings takes note of the visitor, snapping pictures While developing the pictures of the day, Jennings notices the priest has a dark object like a javelin over his head in the pictures he appears in, but the anomaly doesn't appear anywhere else on the filmThe next scene shows Kathy Thorn with Damien, traveling through a safari park, and various animals react with fear or anger towards Damien It climaxes in a harrowing scene where a group of baboons attack the car that Kathy is driving forcing her to speed awayMeanwhile, Robert Thorn is followed by the priest that met with him earlier and is pulled aside at a public event the priest tells him that his wife is in danger and he needs to talk to him Jennings is also at the event, taking pictures The pictures again show the dark anomaly above the priestThe next day, when Thorn meets with the priest again, Father Brennan again tells him that Damien is the son of the devil, born of a jackal, and will kill everyone around him and will kill his wife's unborn child as well as his wife The priest instructs Thorn to go to Israel to the city of Megiddo to find a man who can tell him how to kill the son of the devil Brennan tells Thron about an ancient prophecy that an antrichrist will be born, grow to manhood, and take over the world and lead it into death and destruction Thorn thinks he is crazy and says never to bother him again As the priest leaves the park, a sudden rainstorm comes up and the priest is impaled by a church spire in a freak accident while trying to get into a nearby churchThorn goes home and his wife tells him she is pregnant Startled by this news, he also receives a phone call telling him to examine the newspaper's cover story about the priest's bizarre death Kathy has been agitated by Damien of late,

to his apartment Paul lives by himself with only his housekeeper Female pronounced Fee-MAL-ee Ruby Dee to look after him Irena and Paul are descended from a line of 'cat people,' people who turn into panthers after mating and who must then kill in order to take human form againIrena knows nothing about this side of her ancestry She is still a virgin, so she has no idea what sex will do to her On the other hand, Paul has been living with this knowledge for years and has worked out a system whereby he uses hookers as his prey In fact, on Irena's first night in New Orleans, Paul arranges for a hooker Lynn Lowry to meet with him at a cheap hotel Unfortunately for Paul but fortunately for the hooker, the hooker escapes with her life and Paul is left in his panther form, trapped in a hotel room Curator OliverYates John Heard and his assistants, Alice Perrin Annette O'Toole and Joe Creigh Ed Begley Jr, from the New Orleans Zoo, are called to capture the black panther and put him behind barsWith Paul gone, Irena decides to spend her first full day in New Orleans by seeing the sights First, a taxi ride through the French Quarter then a stop at the zoo where she is fascinated by the new panther, so fascinated that she is still there sketching him 1-12 hours after the zoo has closed When Oliver startles Irena, she drops her sketch pad and runs for the trees, winding up on top of one Oliver coaxes her down After noticing that Irena feels excessively warm, Oliver takes her inside and puts a cool cloth on her forehead Thinking her exhaustion might be due to hunger, they decide to get something to eat During the dinner conversation, Oliver learns that Irena is looking for a job and hires her to work in the zoo's gift shopIrena's first day on the job is memorable Alice introduces herself to Irena, and the two get lunch A strange woman calls Irena 'mi hermana' my sister That afternoon, as Irena continues looking at the black panther, it suddenly goes crazy and when Joe tries subduing it, the panther graphically rips Joe's right arm off and he quickly bleeds to death By the time Oliver gets back with his gun to kill the beast, however, the panther has disappeared When Irena gets home that evening, Paul returns, but he no longer seems so brotherly He claims that he was in jail during his time away He tries to get Irena to have sex with him, telling her that he's the only one who can touch her and she's the only one who can touch him Irena knows only that she is attracted to Oliver and wants nothing to do with having sex with her brother, so she runs offWhile running in the street, Irena flags down a police car, but they find no one chasing her However, when the police dog begins going nuts, they do a search of the area The police dog leads them to Paul's basementwhere they find a cage, chains, and parts of several bodies A check on Paul Gallier shows that he's been in and out of mental institutions since the age of 10, when his parents killed themselves They were circusperformers, and Paul grew up around big cats Thinking that Paul might have been the one keeping the escaped panther, they call the Zoo Oliver and Alice come over It is the policeman's opinion that Paul meant to kill Irena, so he suggests that she find someplace else to live Oliver offers her a place to stay with himIrena is becoming more and more troubled As if the stuff with Paul wasn't bad enough, one night she finds herself running on all fours after a rabbit It's also becoming apparent to her that she is falling in love with Oliver, and he with her, but

Suddenly she receives an urgent call on her monitor from none other than the President of Earth Claude Dauphin He informs her that a young scientist named Durand-Durand went missing sometime during a mission to the North Star and is believed to have landed somewhere in the Tau Ceti star system Not much is known about this region of space-- the President worries that Durand's invention, the positronic ray, may fall into the hands of a primitive culture beings who might seek to use this technology as a weapon and launch an intergalactic war Since the Earth, free of all conflict for centuries, lacks military and police personnel, the President tasks Barbarella with a mission to find the scientist He teleports her some weapons and a device that will signal the presence of Durand-Durand The latter has a tonguebox incorporated in its design which can translate any languageBarbarella spends most of the journey to Tau Ceti in suspended animation She awakens just in time to lose control of her spacecraft and crash land on Planet 16, which her spaceship informs her contains an atmosphere similar to Earth's She changes into a new outfit to explore the arctic terrain The first humanoids she meets are a pair of twin girls-- they jabber to her excitedly in a language she can't understand Before she can adjust her tonguebox, one of them knocks Barbarella unconscious with a piece of ice The girls then pull the dazed explorer along in their sled, which is attached to a manta ray-like creature that glides across the iceThe girls arrive with Barbarella at the wreck of another craft where several other sets of twin children are sheltered and indigo-blue bunny rabbits abound Barbarella recognizes the wreck as the Alpha-1, former spaceship of Durand-Durand The children tie Barbarella to a post and bring out several mechanical dolls that walk towards her It soon becomes apparent that the dolls all have sharp metal teeth and hinged jaws They bite Barbarella while the children giggle gleefully, amused by their gameSuddenly a man appears with several armored guards He cracks a whip and captures the children in a net, then unties Barbarella Once she gets her tonguebox working, she's able to understand him when he explains that he is a Catchman named Mark Hand Ugo Tognazzi and that all children are sent away to the forests of Weir until they've reached a serviceable age, at which point he captures them and brings them back to civilization He offers Barbarella a ride back to her spaceship When she asks how she can repay him, he tells her that he'd like to make love to her Back on Earth, when people want to bond, erotically, they each take an exultation transference pill and press their palms against one another's Barbarella is prepared to do this with the Catchman, but he's not interested in all that, he tells Barbarella that he wants to have sex on the bed in his snowship She reluctantly agrees to do it the old-fashioned way, but soon discovers that she finds the experience quite enjoyable The Catchman gives her a fur and repairs her spaceship, only when she tries to fly off, the ship's computer informs her that it's been repaired

World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks Oskar Schindler Liam Neeson, a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern Ben Kingsley, a functionary in the local Judenrat Jewish Council who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced for trade on the black market Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as Herr Direktor, while Stern handles all administration Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less the Jews themselves get nothing the wages are paid to the Reich Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killedAmon Gth Ralph Fiennes arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszw The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected He nevertheless is careful to befriend Gth and, through Stern's attention to bribery, he continues to enjoy the SS's support and protection The camp is built outside the city at Paszw During this time, Schindler bribes Gth into allowing him to build a sub-camp for his workers, with the motive of keeping them safe from the depredations of the guards Eventually, an order arrives from Berlin commanding Gth to exhume and destroy all bodies of those killed in the Krakow ghetto, dismantle Paszw, and to ship the remaining Jews to Auschwitz Schindler prevails upon Gth to let him keep his workers so that he can move them to a factory in his old home of Zwittau-Brinnlitz, in Moravia -- away from the final solution now fully under way in occupied Poland Gth acquiesces, charging a certain amount for each worker Schindler and Stern assemble a list of workers that should keep them off the trains to AuschwitzSchindler's List comprises these skilled inmates, and for many of those in Paszw, being included means the difference between life and death Schindler also plays a game of high card draw for one worker in particular, Helen Hirsch, who'd been serving as Gth's housekeeper and had been a victim of his continual abuse Gth is reluctant, hoping to run away with her but knowing that such an action would result in his death as well as hers He also floats the idea of simply executing her but finally decides to play Schindler for Helen's life Helen is among those who board the train to BrinnlitzAll of the men on Schindler's list arrive safely at the new site, with the exception to the train carrying the women and the children, which is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz There, the women are directed to what they believe is a gas chamber after a

from her newly remarried father, an agent from the Environmental Protection Agency Kinney and her new stepmother Meg Tilly, and her 10-year-old brother Andy Marti's father has been asigned to this remote military base on an assignment to check for contaminates which may be the cause of a recent outburst of mass hysteria on the base Before arriving, the family stops at a rural gas station where Marti encounters a wild-eyed serviceman who tells her that they are everywhere When Marti runs to tell her father, the serviceman is goneUpon arrival, Marti attempts to fit in with her new envirment, hanging around with the base commander's rebellious daughter, and by flirting with a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young WirthWhile examining a soil specimen, Marti's father is approached by a man named Major Collins Forrest Whitaker, who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia the fear of sleep, saying that many people on the base are now frightened of sleep and are paranoid and suspicious Marti's father doesn't take the Major very seriouslyHe is forced to take it seriously, however after extremely high levels of toxicity and mutant plant life are discovered on the base That night, Marti Malone's step-brother approaches his sleeping mother, but she crumbles to dust as her soulless and egotistical pod double exits from the closetDonning a nightgown, the pod-woman engages in an attempt to convince her husband that the pod invasion is a good thing, claiming it will cause the death of confusion and anger She also claims that there's no place at all to go, as the invasion is not an isolated incident He is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and her step-brother arrive and drag her father out the door His pod-wife dashes to the door and emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts her comrades to the danger of a human beingFor the rest of the movie, Marti and her father and Andy are chased across the base by the taken over soldiers and civilians on the base, where they encounter a few remaining humans who join them and are also are chased by the pods Searchlights go on, and the pod clones swarm over the baseHiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse filled with barrels of poisonous waste, Marti's father promises to find help He sneaks up to the window of Major Collins' office and enters by smashing a window Inside, he finds the hysterical Major attempting to call for help, but gets blocked on the other end of the line by the bureaucratic pod-people At first, he suspects Marti's father of being a pod-man, but when he realizes he isn't, he explains while wolfing down sleep-prevention pills that it is too late for running all they can do is fight Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of the fearsome pod-people, led by the base commander Marti's father hides Instead of shooting all of the pod-people with his gun, the Major allows them to try to convince him that the individual is never important, and that only mindlessness and heartlessness can solve problems He shoots himself rather than live in such a worldMarti's father returns to Marti and Andy, and asks them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks Frightened by all this, Marti asks her father where exactly they're going He never gives her a straight answer, instead replying I know what I'm doing Don't worryI know exactly what I'm doing Realizing that her father was podded while he was away, she swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother, but her father tries to keep her in the van Adding to all this is the helicopter pilot, Tim Young, who still hasn't figured out what has been going on, stepping onto the scene, and Marti takes his gun and shoots her pod-father dead The pilot is horrified to see him shrink into a ma"

divorce court where Polish immigrant Karol Karol Zbigniew Zamachowski is pleading with the judge the same legal proceedings that Juliette Binoche's character Julie briefly stumbled upon in the previous film 'Blue' Despite his difficulty in understanding French, Karol is made to understand that his French wife Dominique Julie Delpy does not love him The grounds for divorce are humiliating Karol was unable to consummate the marriage Along with his wife, he loses his means of support a beauty salon they jointly owned, his legal residency in France, and the rest of his cash in a series of mishaps, and is soon a beggar living on the streets He only retains a 2-franc coin that he got as change from the phone while trying to speak with his now ex-wifeIn a Paris Mtro station, performing songs for spare change, Karol meets and is befriended by another Pole, Mikoaj Janusz Gajos While Karol has lost his wife and his property, Mikoaj is married and successful, he offers Karol a job consisting of killing someone who wants to be dead but does not have enough courage to do it himself Through a hazardous scheme, Mikoaj helps him return to Poland hidden in the suitcase shown at the beginning of the film, which is later stolen by employees at the airport The airport thieves, eager to find something valuable inside their stolen trunk, are angry when they open it and they find Karol inside The thieves beat up Karol and leave him behind in a nearby garbage dumpDespite his mishap, Karol returns to working as a hairdresser with his brother Jerzy Stuhr whom he now moves in with After a while, Karol, no longer content to working at his brother's salon, quits his job and sets up to make himself a pot of cash in newly capitalist Poland Karol takes another job as as a bodyguard in a seemingly innocent cash exchange office Mikoaj meets Karol in a Warsaw Metro tunnel for the execution of the suicide, it turns out to be that Mikoaj is the intended victim and asks Karol to kill him Karol shoots a blank into Mikoaj's chest and asks him if he really wants to go through with it as the next bullet is real Mikoaj refuses and is able to feel alive again Using his position as a deceptively foolish bodyguard, Karol spies on his bosses and discovers their scheme to purchase different pieces of land that they knew were going to be targeted by big companies for development and resell for large profits Karol beats them to it, and then tells his ex-bosses that if they kill him all his estate shall go to the Catholic Church, and they are therefore forced to purchase all the land from him With the money he gained from this scheme and with the payment from Mikoaj, the two go into business of a vaguely defined but possibly illegal nature togetherKarol becomes ruthlessly ambitious, focusing his energies on money-making schemes while learning to speak French and brooding over his wife's abandonment He uses his new financial influence in a world where, as several characters observe, you can buy anything to execute a complex scheme to first win back Dominique, and then destroy her lifeKarol takes his revenge against his ex-wife by faking his own death after which she shows up for his funeral Karol then sneaks into her hotel room and has sex with her to prove his potency again Then afterwords, Dominique is arrested and imprisoned for his 'murder' The final image of the film shows Karol secretly visiting his wife in prison and staring at Dominique through the window of her prison cell Karol then suddenly feels ashamed at himself for this revenge

a hard-deck - and then compounds this faux pas by overflying a flight tower at absurdly low altitude just to show himself offIceman chews out Maverick for his unsafe attitude, but Maverick refuses to have any of it, even after the School's leader, Commander Michael Viper Metcalf Tom Skerritt summons him to his office and threatens to expel him should he continue this way Metcalf, however, knows Maverick, for Maverick's father flew with him in Vietnam off the USS Oriskany CVA-34 and was shot down when he engaged the enemy in neutral airspaceThe contest between Maverick and Iceman continues in a later exercise Viper and Jester team up against Maverick and fellow F14 pilot Hollywood Maverick breaks a cardinal rule by abandoning his wingman to go after Viper, and in so doing Hollywood is shot down and then the same fate befalls MaverickBut the worst is yet to come, for Maverick is teamed with Iceman and Maverick, determined to win the School contest, angrily chews out Iceman for taking too long to attack an enemy craft Maverick takes the shot, but when the two aircraft get close, the backwash from Iceman's thrusters cripple Maverick's engines and the F14 plunges toward the sea Goose barely succeeds in yanking open the emergency ejection handles, but when the figh"

become victim number nineWho is the murderer It could be anyone the viewer knows that it is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre Neighbors are turning in neighbors and fingering strangers in the street just for talking to a child The police are on the job 24 hours a day, but all they have turned up so far is some Ariston cigarette butts, some sugar grains, and a bag that held candy They have investigated over 1,500 clues and have compiled 60 volumes of documents Every thicket, every bush, every hole in the area has been combed Every place from flop houses to underworld hangouts are being raided every nightIn fact, the police investigation has been so thorough that the Underground is getting worried about the shakedowns Underworld boss Schrnker Gustaf Grndgens has come to the conclusion that the child killer must be found before the police ruin business After a lengthy discussion with all the Underworld bosses in attendance there is a wonderful scenario where the Underworld bosses discuss strategies while the police do the same, such that it hard to tell the difference between Gangsters and Police, they decide that the best solution is to monitor all children at all times and that the best persons to do that, the only ones who can be seen on the streets without arousing suspicions, are beggars So, every street has its beggar sitting in a doorway, having a smoke on the corner, watching the children and noting anyone following or with a childA break comes in the person of a blind balloon peddlar Georg John who hears a man whistling a tune and remembers the same tune being whistled by a man who purchased a balloon on the day Elsie Beckmann was murdered He alerts his block's beggar, who follows the Beckert, who is leading a little girl into a candy store When Beckert makes the mistake of throwing an orange peel on the sidewalk, the beggar pretends to slip on it and, while clutching Beckert for support, he transfers onto the back of Beckert's shoulder a big M that he previously chalked on his palm The beggars are now able to follow the man with the M on his coatMeanwhile, the police have been attempting to trace the origin of a postcard sent by the child killer

off Certain that he has been caught, Beckert runs into an office building The beggars contact Schrnker who sends a group of gangsters to comb the building and capture the child killer Unfortunately, the night watchman sounds an alarm, alerting the police In the minutes before the police arrive, the gangsters find Beckert, and everyone, except for burglar Franz Friedrich Gnass, manages to get out before the police arrive To make Franz sing, Detective Lohmann lies to him that the night watchman at the building was killed during the gangsters' raid The strategy has the desired effect Fearing

becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France D'Artagnan is pursued by Grard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor Grard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it she wanted to give me something to remember her by At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort Michael Wincott and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu Tim Curry, the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties Athos Kiefer Sutherland, Porthos Oliver Platt, and Aramis Charlie SheenUpon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers But before the duels can commence, the captain of the cardinal's guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant musketeers Although D'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, implicating himself with them Displeased but still impressed by D'Artagnan's involvement, the three musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind More of the Cardinals guards, led by Rochefort, arrive and D'Artagnan is capturedD'Artagnan refuses to cooperate with the investigator to the three musketeer's whereabouts or about their intentions which D'Artagnan does know know During an escape attempt, D'Artagnan is able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Cardinal Richelieu and Countess Milady de Winter Rebecca De Mornay, as the Cardinal asks that she deliver a signed treaty to the Duke of Buckingham of England Before he can get a view of the Cardinal's spy, D'Artagnan is caught at the doorway by Rochefort He is then interrogated by the Cardinal to what he knows, and Richelieu ultimately orders D'Artagnan for execution the next morning At the execution, d'Artagnan is saved by Porthos and Aramis, who are dressed as the hooded executioners, and the three make a getaway in the Cardinal's personal coach, driven by Athos While D'Artagnan reveals Richelieu's plans, the three musketeers decide to intercept Richelieu's spy to prove that the Cardinal is guilty of treasonMeanwhile, Cardinal Richelieu tries to convince the young and naive King Louis XIII Hugh O'Conor, about the three rogue musketeers and of his desire to capture them for treason Louis knows that that Richelieu might have a hidden agenda for his reason to track down the three renegade musketeers, but allows him to proceed with the search At the same time, Cardinal Richelieu begins to spend more time around the young king's wife Queen Sophie of Austria Gabrielle Anwar who also finds his presence, creepy, but that he is too powerful to confront, keeps her distance to himThat night, D'Artagnan and the three musketeers stop at an inn to rest Athos tells the story of a count that fell in love with a beautiful woman, but upon discovering that she was branded for execution, betrayed her by giving her up to the authorities The party decides to split up during a skirmish when the cardinal's guards arrive and open fire on them with muskets Athos sends D'Artagnan to ride ahead and intercept the Cardinal's spy and the treaty, but D'Artagnan passes out from

Transylvania, Frankenstein meets his comely new lab assistant Inga Teri Garr, along with the household servants Frau Blcher Cloris Leachman and Igor Marty Feldman who, after hearing Frederick claim his name is pronounced Fronkensteen counter-claims that his is pronounced Eye'-gorInga assists Frederick in discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory Upon reading his grandfather's private journals the doctor is inspired to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead He and Igor successfully exhume and spirit away the enormous corpse of a recently executed criminal, but Igor's attempt to steal the brain of a revered scientist from the local brain depositary goes awry, and he takes one labeled, Do Not Use This Brain Abnormal insteadThe doctor

fails to come to life, but the reassembled monster eventually revives The doctor assists the monster in walking but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, it attacks Frederick and must be sedatedMeanwhile, the local townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work Most concerned is Inspector Kemp Kenneth Mars, who visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Blcher is setting the creature free After she reveals the monster's love of music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castleWhile roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit cameo by Gene Hackman these scenes directly parody ones from the original Frankenstein movies Frederick recaptures the monster, wins him over with flattery, and finally fully acknowledges his heritageAfter a period of training, he offers a theater full of illustrious guests the sight of The Creature following simple commands The demonstration continues with Frederick and the Monster launching into the musical number Puttin' on the Ritz, complete with top hats and tails and no small amount of clumsiness on the monster's part, which ends disastrously when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster He becomes enraged and charges into the audience where he is captured and chained by policeAfter being tormented by a sadistic jailer who smiles, the Monster escapes again, then kidnaps and ravishes the not-unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penisThe townspeople, led by Inspector Kemp, hunt for the Monster Desperate to get the creature back and correct his mistakes, Frederick plays music and lures the Monster back to the castle Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Dr Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mobThe film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated Monster, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return from

been shot down Finding them under heavy fire from an Iraqi tank and infantry, her men dropped an auxiliary fuel bladder on the tank and ignited it with a flare gun Shortly after, her helicopter was also hit and downed The two crews were unable to join forces The survivors were rescued the next day, but Walden had been killedAt first, everything seems to be straightforward, but Serling begins to notice inconsistencies between the testimonies of the witnesses Walden's co-pilot, Warrant Officer One Rady Tim Guinee, praises Walden's character and performance, but was hit and rendered unconscious early on Serling then sees Walden's medic, Specialist Ilario Matt Damon, who also praises Walden by his account, Walden was the one who came up with the idea of the improvised incendiary Staff Sergeant Monfriez Lou Diamond Phillips, however, tells Serling that Walden was a coward and that he was responsible for destroying the tank The members of the other downed crew mention that they heard the distinctive sound of an M16 being used in the firefight during the rescue around the other helicopter, but Walden's crew denies firing one during the rescue, as theirs was out of ammunition When Serling visits Walden's crew chief, Sergeant Altameyer Seth Gilliam, who is dying of cancer in a hospital Altameyer manages to get some words out, further confusing Serling, before self-medicating himself into unconsciousnessUnder pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg Michael Moriarty, to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner Scott Glenn to prevent another cover up When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming trainAfter finding an AWOL Ilario, Serling discovers that Monfriez wanted to escape under cover of darkness, which would have meant leaving Rady behind Altameyer was ready to follow his lead and Ilario was wavering, but Walden refused to go along, resulting in an armed standoff with Monfriez When an Iraqi infantryman appeared suddenly behind Monfriez, Walden fired at him Mistakenly believing he was the target, Monfriez shot back and seriously wounded her Walden, however, regained control of her men The next morning, Walden stayed behind to cover their evacuation, firing the M16 Monfriez deliberately lied to the rescuers, telling them that she was dead so she would be left behind Altameyer, injured and unable to say anything but no, was ignored Ilario remained silent, fearing a court-martial A-10 airplanes then napalmed the wreckageSerling presents his final report to Hershberg Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony Later, Serling tearfully tells the Boylars the truth about the manner of their son's death In the last moments of the film, it is shown that Walden had transported Boylar's body away from the

m containment wall, all inmates are sentenced to life imprisonment, and have formed gangs which control the crumbling, garbage-strewn cityTraveling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, Air Force One, the plane of the President of the United States, is hijacked by a sole member of a revolutionary organization opposed to the government a women impersonating a

crash Hauk assembles a platoon of soldiers and they travel to the crash site in a fleet of helicopters But when they arrive, they find the escape pod empty, indicating that the President has been taken hostage An emissary of the inmates, named Romero Frank Doubleday, appears and tells Hauk and the soldiers that they have the President and if they do not leave the island in 30 seconds, the President will be killed Romero offers them one of the President's severed fingers as evidence With no other choice, Hauk orders his men to return to the helicopters and they fly back to Liberty Island In his office, Hauk meets with the arrived Secretary of State Charles Cypress who puts him in telephone contact with the Vice President where Hauk asks for authorization of a rescue attempt and

the President, and retrieves a cassette tape that contains important information on nuclear fusion, Hauk will give him a full pardon However, Plissken must complete his mission before the international summit that the President was due to attend, which begins in 24 hours After Plissken reluctantly agrees to attempt the rescue, Hauk secretly has him injected with microscopic explosives that will blow open his carotid arteries in his neck in 24 hours one day The explosives cannot be defused until within 15 minutes before they go off, as a way of ensuring that Snake does not abandon his mission and escape, nor find another way to remove them If he returns with the President and the tape in time for the summit, Hauk will save him by having the charges in his neck neutralized with

their careers with the urban drama, Menace II Society, and this effort has a 70s urban setting The style and skill of these talented filmmakers is immediately apparent and the script which they co-wrote with Michael Henry Brownhas well-developed characters and great tension along with explosive action scenes framed with an engrossing small scale story The acting is excellent, but the real star here is the Hughes direction which is cool and inspiredLarenz Tate is Anthony Curtis, a good-natured high school kid in 60s New York who is enjoying life with his girlfriend, Delilah and good friends, Skip Chris Tucker in an early role and Jose Freddy Rodriguez and running numbers for a local tough guy, Kirby Keith David Those days are not to last, however, as all three of the young friends end up in Vietnam Following a fairly lengthy and well-done segment in the Nam, all three end up back in the old neighbourhood, where Anthony finds adjusting to civilian life difficult Soon and rather suddenly, the whole bunch of them are planning an armoured car heist, and ohhhh boy, what a heist it turns out to ben the spring of 1969, Anthony Curtis Larenz Tate is about to graduate from high school However, Anthony is not going to college, but needing to get away from home to find himself, he enlists in the US Marine Corps shortly after graduating high school He is sent to Vietnam,

gung-ho lieutenant, Dugan Jaimz Woolvett, and his wartime friend, Cleon Bokeem Woodbine, a religious yet deadly staff sergeant During their tour in Vietnam as members of a Force Recon unit, they experience the horror of war, losing several fellow Marines during combat The Marines specifically, Cleon also commit atrocities, including executing enemy prisoners and beheading corpses for war trophies One of their squad is the victim of terror tactics of the North Vietnamese D'ambrosio Michael Imperioli, who is disemboweled and castrated alive While waiting for medevac, Anthony, succumbing

team killed Dugan is killed after Skip freezes up during the gunfight when he is ordered to cover him Cleon manages to hold off the enemy long enough for Anthony and the last of the crew to escapeWhen

Marlon Brando and terminate his command with extreme prejudice Kurtz apparently went insane and now commands his own Montagnard troops inside neutral CambodiaWillard joins a Navy PBR commanded by Chief Albert Hall and crewmen Lance Sam Bottoms, Chef Frederic Forrest and Mr Clean Laurence Fishburne They rendezvous with reckless Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore Robert Duvall, a commander of an attack helicopter squadron, who initially scoffs at them Kilgore befriends Lance, both being keen surfers, and agrees to escort them through the Viet Cong-filled coastal mouth of the Nung River due to the surfing conditions there Amid napalm air strikes on the locals and Ride of the Valkyries playing over the helicopter loudspeakers, the beach is taken and Kilgore orders others to surf it amid enemy fire While Kilgore nostalgically regales about a previous strike, Willard gathers his men to the PBR, transported via helicopter, and begins the journey upriverWillard sifts through files on

experiment Things start progressing in a rapid speed, when the higher authorities become aware of the project They force Dr Angelo's supervisor to reinstate the original project and subject Jobe to the same virtual training as the chimp, making him into a soldier This is when things take a turn for the worse Jobe already gained the ability to read people's minds, but is now also able to move

at the end of the match Jake's brother Joey LaMotta Joe Pesci is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fightsJoey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts Frank Vincent, on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie Cathy Moriarty at the edge of the pool Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives inJake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como Nicholas Colosanto and VickieThe recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew Joey has a word with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother

his brother's house, he starts a fight with Joey Defending his championship belt against Laurent Dauthuille, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other

salesman, attempting to contact a doctor for his daughter In the phone booth next to him is Dave Moss Ed Harris attempting to sell properties in Rio Rancho Estates They both go into the mens room and start complaining about the type of potential customers, or leads, they have been getting from their sales company They exit the bathroom and Ricky Roma Al Pacino is successfully selling real estate to a man at the barWhen they return to their office, a representative, a hot-tempered, arrogant businessman called Blake Alec Baldwin, in a role written just for the movie not in the original stage play sent by the owners of the company they work for, Mitch and Murray, is there He berates them over their poor sales, and announces a contest in which the best-selling salesman gets a Cadillac, and the worst performing salesman is fired The salesmen themselves blame their lack of sales on the poor quality of the leads they have gotten Blake then tells them that he has some premium leads for sales in a new development, the Glengarry Leads These are buyers who are both likely to buy and able to afford the land they are selling, so getting these leads is incredibly important to all the salesmen Blake tells them that the leads will go to the best performing salesmen, the first likely being Roma, who has been leading the office in sales on the big boardShelley is so distraught with the situation that he confronts the office manager, Mr Williamson Kevin Spacey, about providing him with the better leads He takes advantage of Shelley's vulnerable situation by offering to sell him the better leads at fifty dollars a piece as well as a cut of 20 of all his profits Shelley is unable to afford the terms and is stuck attempting to sell his second-rate leadsThe movie then skips to Dave Moss and co-worker, George Aaronow Alan Arkin, going to a local diner across town and talking about the unethical behavior of their employer, Williamson, and about their mean and ungrateful rep, Blake, over their sales work Moss proposes that they strike back at Mitch and Murray by stealing all the Glengarry leads and sell them to Jerry Graff, a competing real estate agency, for 7,500 Moss's plan would require Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary, and steal all the prime leads Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accomplice simply because he knows about the proposed robbery Aaronow continues to declineMeanwhile, Ricky Roma is selling real estate to a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk Jonathon Pryce back at the Chinese restaurant by promising financial success in investing Roma does not broach the subject of a real estate deal until he has completely won Lingk over with his speech Framing it as being an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays upon Lingk's feelings of complacency and insecurityACT IIThe next day, the salesmen come into work to find that the office has been burglarized and the Glengarry leads have been stolen Williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private It would appear that Aaronow and Moss have done it due to their nervous attitudes As a police inspector interviews each of them one by one in Mr Williamson's office, Roma is especially distraught because he was the only one whose successful sales record entitled him to the Glengarry leads Everyone is in a terrible mood except for Levene who reveals that he managed to sell 82,000 in property the night before He explains his success story to Roma who listens with great respect and happiness for his co-worker The negative tone in the office overshadows Levene's great sell After his interrogation, Moss leaves in disgust, only after having one explosive last encounter with

folklore Her husband, Trevor Lyle Xander Berkeley, is a university professor, of whom she suspects infidelity with one of his younger students, and we suspect her home life isn't quite satisfying, despite the fact that she seems to be very much in love with Trevor Helen and Bernie have been interviewing numerous people about various 'urban legend' type stories One young woman tells them a story about Candyman, a mythical being who has a hook instead of a right hand The legend goes that Candyman will appear behind you if you say his name five times while looking in a mirror Clara Marianna Elliott dares rebel other-boyfriend Billy Ted Raimi to repeat Candyman's name five times in front of the mirror while she's babysitting the Johnson family's baby Billy only repeats it four times but when she is left alone in the bathroom, getting ready to lose her virginity to Billy and not Michael, her too good boyfriend, Clara repeats the name a fifth time Then, she turns off the light and right behind her, Candyman's appears and kills her with her hooked armAs Helen reviews the recorded conversation in an empty classroom one night at the university, a cleaning woman overhears the story about Candyman and pays special attention to it Henrietta Mosely Barbara Alston calls in another cleaning woman, Kitty Calver Sarina C Grant, who tells Helen about the murders that have taken place in Cabrini-Green, Chicago, the low income housing project where she lives The people of Cabrini-Green have attributed the deaths to Candyman, as the victims have been butchered with a weapon determined to be a hook The mention of the murders leads Helen to research it in archived newspapers, and she finds out the names of the victims Even more intriguing to her is the fact that her own apartment building was designed exactly like Cabrini-Green she learns that it was intended as another housing development, but eventually the idea was scrapped when the developers realized that the location was too desirable Helen and Bernie theorize that the white developers relocated the housing project to a more forbidding area that would keep the ghetto separated from the rest of the city Helen is aware that the units in her building are connected to one another through the medicine chests in the bathrooms when removed, they reveal a small space that links the apartments together Helen knows that Cabrini-Green's apartments must be the same, and that the stories of Candyman coming out of the medicine chest could indicate a human assailant who had also made this discovery With Bernadette in tow, she visits Cabrini-Green and finds the apartment of one of the murder victims on the other side of the medicine chest is a strange lair, with holes in the wall and elaborate graffiti-style artwork depicting a large man's head with a hole in the wall for a mouth Helen is fascinated by it, as well as the fact that an altar appears to have been constructed there as well, with candy left behind as an offeringHelen and Bernie meet Anne-Marie McCoy Vanessa Williams, the neighbor of the deceased victim Anne-Marie is initially hostile to them, as she feels the presence of white people in the all-black housing development indicates nothing but trouble Bernie herself is black, but Helen is white, and the tenants they meet on the way inside mistake them for police officers But eventually Anne-Marie softens and invites them into her apartment Helen is taken by Anne-Marie's baby boy, Anthony Lanesha Martin Latesha Martin admitting she would like to have a child of her own one day Anne-Marie says that she is determined to make a better life for her son, one that does not involve Cabrini-Green or the drug-dealing youths that loiter on its groundsWhile at dinner one night with Bernie, Trevor, and a few of Trevor's colleagues, Helen makes the m"

preparing for two rites of passage the marriage of one and military service for three of them The movie has a very well orchestrated soundtrack that is no dated like many movies from the 70's and 80'sThey work together, hang out in a local bar and enjoy weekends deer hunting But their placid life is soon to be changed after three enlist in the airborne infantry to go to Vietnam Before they go, Steven marries the pregnant Angela, with whom he has not had sex, and their wedding party is also the men's farewell party The hall is decorated with the boy's high school pictures and lots of American flagsNick's girlfriend, Linda, makes breakfast for her father while wearing a bridesmaid's dress Her father, an abusive and hallucinating alcoholic, is upstairs and alone, having an alcoholic attack and has trashed his room Linda brings him his breakfast and he hits her a couple of times leaving a bruise on her face She leaves for the wedding and takes her belongings to Nick's where she asks to stay for a while as the men are going away in service Mike is upset and walks out when Linda shows upAt the Russian wedding reception, there is lots of drinking, ethnic dancing and wedding rituals This is a very long scene and sets up the relationships and foreshadows some of what is to come Mike spends a lot of the time at the bar drinking and watching Linda from afar During the final ceremony of drinking from a dual wine cup, the convention is the couple wil have a good life if they don't spill any wine but the camera catches some drips on the bride's dress Nick proposes to Linda after she catches the bouquet and she accepts The bride and groom leave the party in Mike's decorated Cadillac and Mike chases after them stripping himself naked as he runs, winding up with Nick in a basketball court Nick makes Mike promise to bring him back to Clairton if something happensThe morning after, with the car still decorated from the wedding, the men drive into the mountains to go deer hunting Mike takes hunting very seriously, having expressed his one shot theory to Nick previously, and gives Stan a cold shoulder when Stan wants to borrow socks and then can't find his hunting boots He asks Mike for his extra pair and Mike refuses, having grown tired of Stan's lack of preparedness on previous trips Stan in frustration brings out a small handgun he carries and Nick breaks up the confrontation The next morning, Mike and Nick go out into the woods Rachmaninoff's dramatic piece Praise the Name of the Lord plays on the soundtrack Mike has told Nick he is the only one of the group he will hunt with, having no respect for the others Mike stalks and shoots a deer, bringing it down in a single shotThe troupe returns to Clairton and they go straight to John's bar John plays a somber piece on the piano and the men sit mostly silent, contemplating their last night together as a groupThe scene cuts to a mountainous region of Vietnam where a small village is a battleground

enterprise leaves Vulcan, having voted to return to Earth to face punishment for their actions in Star Trek III The Search for Spock They depart for Earth in the Klingon scout-class warbird they captured from Commander Kruge at the Genesis planet, now re-christened by Dr McCoy as the HMS BountyMeanwhile, a strange probe is also on course for Earth As it travels, it emits a strange signal that disables all of the technology that it encounters, leaving a trail of damaged starships and star bases in its wake Upon its arrival at Earth, the planet itself is jeopardized as high technology fails, the oceans are evaporated, and the atmosphere is ionized Clouds block out the sun, which Earth cannot survive withoutArriving within our solar system, the crew of the Bounty analyzes the strange signals from the probe and realizes they are a representation of whale song, an apparent attempt to communicate with the long-extinct humpback whales that formerly lived in Earth's oceans but were hunted to extinction in the 21st Century The crew decides that the only way to answer the probe's signals is to travel back in time and obtain humpback whalesUsing the slingshot-around-the-sun maneuver first developed in the TV series, they take the Bounty back to 20th Century Earth where two whales are detected in the vicinity of San Francisco Cloaked, the Bounty lands in Golden Gate Park, but the strain of time travel has depleted it's energy source of dilithium crystalsOnce in the city, the crew splits to accomplish three different missions Locate the whales, build a tank within the Bounty that can carry the giant beasts, and locate a source of high-energy photons with which the crystals can be regenerated Kirk William Shatner and Spock Leonard Nimoy will locate the whales, Sulu George Takei, Scotty James Doohan and Dr McCoy DeForest Kelley will find materials to build the tank and Chekov Walter Koenig and Uhura Nichelle Nichols will find an energy source to repair the dilithium core The team finds their way into downtown San Francisco and discover that society of the 20th Century is still using money Kirk sells some antique eyeglasses given to him by McCoy to an antique dealer for 100 and splits the money between himself and the other teamsKirk and Spock go in search of the whales, locating them at Sausalito's Cetacean Institute a re-dress of the Monterey Bay Aquarium There, they encounter Dr Gillian Taylor Catherine Hicks, the assistant director of the Institute and keeper of the whales During a regular tour, Spock dives into the whale tank and mind-melds with one of the whales, but is caught in the act and Kirk and Spock are ejected from the InstituteWalking along Marine Drive in San Francisco, they are found by Dr Taylor and given a ride to Golden Gate Park to drop off Spock While she drives them there, she asks them questions about their interest in the whales Spock reveals that Gracie is pregnant and she stops the car suddenly, somewhat upset and astonished that Spock would know such a factKirk goes to dinner with Gillian and eventually tells her part of his plan -- he doesn't divulge that the whales are needed to save Earth in the future he tells her he's attempting to repopulate the species Gillian is incredulous but skeptical Kirk asks her for the radio frequency of the tracker the whales will be tagged with and she avoids the question However, she does reveal that the whales are to be released into the ocean at noon the next day Kirk suddenly realizes he's on a much tighter timeline than he believed When Gillian drops Kirk off at Golden Gate Park and he asks her for the frequency, she still refuses to turn it over As she drives away she just misses him transporting back into the Klingon warbirdMeanwhile, McCoy and

evening to find his wife Sela Ward dying following a brutal attack and a mysterious one-armed man with a prosthetic arm escaping Despite his attempts to save her and his testimony about the one-armed man, Kimble is convicted of first-degree murder, due to evidence such as a misunderstood 9-1-1 call, his fingerprints found on the lamp, the gun, and the bullets, and no signs of forced entry by the one-armed man Kimble is sentenced to life in prisonDuring the bus ride to the prison, one of the prisoners fakes a seizure and begins to foam at the mouth as if poisoned A guard unlocks the cage separating him from the prisoner to assist him The prisoner stabs him with a shank made from a concealed sharpened toothbrush, and chaos ensues Another guard shoots the prisoner with a shotgun A second prisoner tries to grab the gun from the guard, but in the struggle, the gun goes off and kills the driver The bus crashes through a guardrail, rolls down a hill, and lands on a railroad track The light from an approaching freight train appears, and Kimble manages to pull himself and one of the guards to safety just as the train rams into the bus at speed The bus is dragged on the front of the first locomotive for several hundred feet, but upon crossing a trestle, the first locomotive's coupler breaks, and every car from the second engine on back derails Kimble manages to outrun the derailing locomotive as it buries itself nose-first in the ditchKimble is freed from his chains by another survivor, Copeland, and both escape from the scene on footA car arrives at the crash site, containing Deputy United States Marshal Samuel Gerard Tommy Lee Jones, who leads a team of men from the US Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force, including Marshals Cosmo Renfro Joe Pantoliano, Bobby Biggs Daniel Roebuck, Erin Poole L Scott Caldwell, and Noah Newman Tom Wood They observe the debris, and Gerard finds the local sheriff, Rollins, interviewing the old guard who survived the wreck with minor injuries The guard, given the suddenness of the wreck, is under the impression that all of the prisoners were killed in the wreck, and takes credit for Kimble's actions getting the other guard out of the bus Gerard requests for Rollins to establish police checkpoints, which Rollins is skeptical of doing until Gerard requests to have jurisdiction passed over to him Just then, Cosmo recovers a pair of unshackled leg irons, and a manhunt begins for KimbleThe next morning, as the Marshals watch the cleanup work, the younger guard the one who was wounded in the revolt, after being trapped for more than twelve hours underneath debris from one of the locomotives, is extricated, aliveThere are many close calls where Kimble almost gets captured, mostly brought on by Kimble's compassionate instincts as a doctor The first instance is at a hospital after Kimble shaves off his beard, and changes into a doctor's uniform He very easily avoids being detected by a state trooper at the hospital on the lookout for him He also happens to be present when the ambulance containing the wounded guard arrives He helps the paramedics unfold the wheels on the gurney The guard recognizes Kimble, but Kimble quietly puts the guard's breathing mask down to keep him quiet, and gives the paramedics a detailed description of the guard's likely injuries, which astonishes the paramedics As soon as they leave, Kimble steals their ambulanceKimble is first discovered when he uses his lights and siren going through a grade crossing He is pursued by the Illinois State Police on land and by Gerard in a helicopter running alongside the highway Kimble is forced to a halt by a police road block in a tunnel near a dam He exits the ambulance and is pursued by Gerard through the dam's drainage system At

an indeterminate year of the 21st century in a nameless authoritarian European country during the Christmas season Terrorist bombings are frequent and the government's war on these enemies of the state has lasted for a few decades In a government office a man sitting in a room full of teletype machines swats a fly on the ceiling the fly falls off the ceiling and into one of the teletypes,

nation's Ministry of Information MOI, often daydreaming of himself as a winged warrior saving a beautiful maiden One day he is assigned the task of trying to rectify an error created by a government mishap, causing the arrest and incarceration of a Mr Harry Buttle instead of a suspected terrorist, Harry Tuttle His boss, Mr Kurtzmann Ian Holm, is flustered by the appearance of a compensation check issued to Mrs Buttle for her husband Sam is asked to transfer the funds directly to Mrs Buttle's bank account The request is sent back because she doesn't have a bank account Sam says he'll drive out to her flat and deliver the check in personWhen Sam visits Buttle's widow, he finds the woman in shock in her living room He tries to give her the compensation check but she's too upset and hysterically asks where her husband isHe discovers Jill Layton Kim Greist, the upstairs neighbor of the Buttles, is the same woman as in his dreams Jill is trying to help Mrs Buttle find out what happened to her husband, but she has gotten tired of dealing with the bureaucratic paperwork and the run-around from various departments at MOI, while unbeknownst to her, she is now, in turn,

government will track her downLater that night, Sam comes in contact with the real Harry Tuttle Robert De Niro, a renegade air conditioning specialist who once worked for the government but left due to the amount of paperwork Tuttle has come to Sam's flat to deal with his malfunctioning climate control -- Tuttle's covert work is highly illegal and he's is intensely cautious when he enters Sam's

Newman, a former high school football star, spends a drunken night jumping hurdles on the school athletic field in a tragic attempt to recapture his glory days He falls and injures his right legSome days later, Brick and his older brother, Gooper Jack Carson, visit the family cotton plantation in eastern Mississippi to celebrate their father's 65th birthday on a hot and humid August day The family rumor is that the wealthy patriarch Big Daddy Pollitt Burl Ives may have developed colon cancer and would be forced to quickly settle his will, leaving his money and land to one of his two sons before he diesGooper and his shrew wife Mae Madeleine Sherwood have gone to great lengths to stay in Big Daddy's good favor Gooper has lived his entire life in accordance with his father's casual instructions, and he and Mae have a dynasty of children to carry on the Pollitt name Brick's wife Maggie Elizabeth Taylor is clever and outspoken, and holds no small amount of contempt for Gooper and Mae's entitled attitudes and five spoiled and obnoxious offspring who run around the house unsupervised Brick, recovering from his leg injury on crutches, spends all his time in his bedroom, drinking heavily and argues with Maggie about the dismal state of their marriage Maggie still adores Brick, though she is troubled by his self-destructive behavior, and Brick is angry and sullen towards Maggie because of a yet unspecified incident involving his recently-deceased friend Skipper Adding to the pressure is Gooper's and Mae's constant criticism of Brick and Maggie due to Brick's alcoholism and the fact that they are childlessBig Daddy and his wife Ida Judith Anderson arrive home on their private airplane from the Mayo Clinic where Big Daddy received the news that he is not dying of cancer after all They are greeted at the airport by Gooper, Mae, and their brood of kids, but Big Daddy ignores them and is driven home by Maggie Big Daddy is openly dismissive of Gooper's and Mae's sycophantic attitudes, knowing that they fawn over him in an attempt to secure his money and plantation for themselves Upon arrival back at the Pollitt plantation, Brick refuses to greet his father or come down for the party, and remains in his room, drinkingThe family doctor Larry Gates who had previously examined Big Daddy, speaks privately with Gooper off-camera and Brick, confessing that he lied to the family about Big Daddy's condition to preserve their happiness for his birthday In reality, Big Daddy really has terminal colon cancer and will be dead within a few months The brothers initially keep the information to themselves, but Brick soon tells Maggie, who is deeply saddenedAs the evening wears on, the party wines down as it begins to rain, forcing the few guests and family inside Big Daddy soon grows annoyed with the party and his fickle family and ventures upstairs to speak with Brick, his favorite son He chastises him for his excessive drinking, and for his cold treatment of Maggie Brick grows defensive and even violent when Big Daddy brings up the subject of Skipper, Brick's old football buddy who had jumped from a fifth-floor hotel window to his death a few years before Realizing that there is more to the story, Big Daddy brings Maggie into the conversation She explains that she hated Brick's pro-football career because he always put it before her, and that she hated Skipper for distracting Brick from his marriage Note there is subtle suggestion here that Brick and Skipper had been romantically involved Maggie describes a drunken episode between herself and Skipper in which she considered seducing him simply to spite her husband, but reconsidered at the last minute Brick then explains that Skipper had telephoned him, seeming to think that he and Maggie had actually made love though he had been too drunk to remember clearly Skipper tearfully tried to apologize to his best friend, but Brick angrily hung up on him Skipper killed him"

and receive a lifetime supply of chocolate The world then goes crazy, with Wonka candies being sold out at almost every storeThe first ticket is found by a gluttonous German boy, named Augustus Gloop Michael BollnerThe second ticket is found by a spoiled little girl named Veruca Salt Julie Dawn Cole, whose father utilized his peanut factory workers to open Wonka bars from dawn until duskThe third ticket is found by a girl named Violet Beauregarde Denise Nickerson, who is an avid gum chewer, having chewed a piece of gum for 3 months straight to achieve a world recordThe fourth ticket is found by a boy named Mike TeeVee Paris Themmen, who is obsessed with television, particularly programs regarding cowboysAnd no one notices a mysterious, trenchcoat-clad man Gunter Meisner always showing up whenever anyone claims a ticketWhile these children claim the tickets in turn, and while various adults go to absurd lengths to find the tickets on their own, old Joe uses his tobacco money to buy two Wonka bars, one at a time, for Charlie Neither bar contains a ticket But the bond between Charlie and Joe is all the stronger for thatFinally the Paraguayan television network announces that an eccentric millionaire, living in the Andes, has claimed the fifth ticket With as everyone thinks no more tickets to hunt for, the world gets back to normal Charlie spends one night wandering about town thinking of the chance he missed, but is back at school the next day, doing his best to put it all behind himBut the next morning, he finds a gold sovereign in a storm drain next to the candy shop He fishes out the coin and goes in to buy some candy, including a regular Wonka bar Then as he goes to claim his papers to start his route, he reads a stark headline FIFTH TICKET FRAUD While a crowd of adults is tsk-tsk-ing about the unmitigated gall that Paraguayan con artist showed, Charlie starts, very slowly, to unwrap the Wonka bar he bought And what should he find within, but the fifth golden ticketHis discovery electrifies the townfolk one of their own has claimed the genuine fifth ticket So his fanfare consists of holding it up and celebrating for about a minute or so with his paper-route customers and anyone who happens to be looking on--no big deal compared to the media hype that greeted the other children, but that doesn't matter Not to Charlie What matters is at last he will get a chance to walk into the factory that has mystified him all his life The ticket also entitles him to a lifetime supply of chocolate, but he doesn't think of that just thenBut as he turns the corner, he runs into the very stranger who has insinuated himself into all the other celebrations though Charlie, not being media-savvy, does not know this The stranger introduces himself as Oskar Sluggworth and offers him stock certificates if he will quietly abstract from the factory a prototype of an Everlasting"

added for the film's 1997 special edition and updated for its DVD releaseAn opening title card reads'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'It is a period of civil war Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DeathStar, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia Carrie Fisher races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy'Following the opening crawl, the frame moves down in the star field and we see a pitched battle between two starships in orbit around the desert planet of Tatooine A small Rebel blockade runner, the Tantive IV, is being pursued by a mammoth Imperial star destroyer, the Devastator Inside, protocol droid C-3PO Anthony Daniels and utility droid R2-D2 Kenny Baker are tossed about as their ship endures a barrage of laser bolts, and 3PO concludes that escaping capture will be impossible The Rebel ship is so heavily damaged that its main power reactor must be shut down It is caught in the Imperial destroyer's tractor beam, pulled into the hold of the larger ship, and boarded by stormtroopers from the Empire's 501st LegionA huge firefight ensues in the corridors of the Rebel ship, with many Rebel soldiers being lost in the battle When the smoke clears, Darth Vader David Prowse voice James Earl Jones, a man dressed in a black cape, black armor, and a black helmet that obscures all his features, briefly surveys the damage before interrogating the ship's captain, who claims that the ship is on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan Vader perceives that he is lying, noting that a consular ship would have an ambassador on board In actuality there is a diplomat aboard Princess Leia Organa but she is hiding from Vader, the second-ranking man in the Empire, which tends to support Vader's thesis that somebody on this ship is up to something Upon learning that the plans were not downloaded into the ship's computer, Vader strangles the captain He then tells the troops to search the entire ship and to bring all the passengers to him aliveC-3PO and R2-D2 manage to escape damage from the firefight R2-D2 meets up with Princess Leia, who loads him with the stolen plans and records a holographic message for the small droid to take to the planet's surface R2-D2 and C-3PO get away from the ship aboard an escape pod and go to the planet below Imperial troops choose not to destroy the pod, as their scans detect no living organism on board, and presume it ejected due to a malfunction Moments later the princess is stunned by Imperial troops and taken to Vader He tells her that the Rebels have stolen some secret Imperial plans and transmitted them to her ship She feigns ignorance and protests to Vader that she is a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, but Vader doesn't believe her and orders her taken away Vader's adjutant aide, Commander Jir Al Lampert, insists that holding her captive is dangerous news of her captivity would generate sympathy for the rebellion against the Empire Vader instructs Jir to deceive the Senate and permanently erase any trace of Leia's whereabouts by faking her accidental death Upon being notified by another officer that an empty escape pod was jettisoned during the firefight, he concludes that the Princess hid the stolen plans in the podC-3PO and R2-D2 land on the desert planet R2-D2 mentions a mission to deliver some plans, but C-3PO is more concerned with staying in one piece long enough to find civilization The two split up, and both are eventually captured by a group of diminutive scavengers called Jawas The Jawas are junk traders, and R2-D2 and C-3PO are their newest assets Meanwhile, a

a German gunship that patrols the Tanganyika shore of the lake up to the southern mouth of the river The Ulanga is filled with dangers like animals that can eat you, rocks and white water rapids that can smash and sink a boat It has only been successfully navigated once by a map maker named Spangler a hundred years ago and no one since has repeated the featRose is straggling about the burnt village in shock and despair from her brother's suicide when a Mr Charlie Allnut Humphrey Bogart shows up out of nowhere to save her This scruffy old gin-swigging rummy is a boat captain who is unshaven and crusty Mr Allnut is there to deliver mail and supplies to the village Mr Allnut travels up and down the northern part of the Ulanga on a rusty old 12-foot boat called the African Queen The boat barely runs, powered by a small antique steam engine on its last legs kept together and encouraged to run with a few well placed kicks and bangs from a hammer by Mr Allnut Mr Allnut buries Rev Sayer and takes Rose to the African Queen for safety before the Germans come back While on the African Queen Rose attempts to convince Mr Allnut they should go south down the Ulanga and sink the Louisa Mr Allnut thinks the spinster is a crazy old maid and tells her so And Rose thinks Mr Allnut is washed-up rummy good for nothing coward unfit to be a captain As impossible as it may seem Mr Allnut decides to follow her suggestion because its the only way to avoid the Germans, and probably the only way to shut Rose up and stop her from nagging on and on about her crazy plan to fight the German navyDuring the first few days aboard the African Queen navigating the Ulanga they annoy each other to the point of being disgusted Rose reads her bible while Mr Allnut drinks rum from a generous supply he has on board until he passes out every day Rose decides to dump all of Mr Allnuts bottles of gin into the river one morning while Mr Allnut is still passed out When Mr Allnut awakes, he is emotionally destroyed by the thought of no more booze How could you, Miss Mr Allnut asks over and over as the African Queen smokes and tugs along the Ulanga Rose decides to stop talking to Mr Allnut and gives him the silent treatment until he gives in to her plan to sink the Louisa Mr Allnut continues to talk to Rose even though Rose refuses to acknowledge his existence on the little boat Mr Allnut pretends he doesn't care even though the silence is slowing killing him It is apparent they cannot stand each others company Finally Mr Allnut can't take the silence anymore and agrees to Rose's impossible plan to sink the Louisa using home made torpedoes made by Mr Allnut Mr Allnut says he can make them from the supplies on the boat -

the fabulous powers of recall of Mr Memory Wylie Watson shots are fired In the ensuing panic, a frightened Annabella Smith Lucie Mannheim holds on to Hannay and talks him into taking her back to his flat After the bus ride there, she admits that she is a counterspy, and that she fired the shots to cause confusion because she is being chased by assassins, who are standing outside on the street She claims to know of a plot to steal vital British military secrets, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from his little finger To stop the plot, she needs to go to Scotland to a large house in a small village She mentions thirty-nine steps, but does not explain their meaningThat night, Annabella is stabbed in the back with Hannay's knife, but manages to warn him to flee before dying She is clutching in her hand a map of Scotland with a tiny village circled To sneak out of the watched flat he borrows the uniform of a milkman and soon boards a train to Scotland He sees police searching the train and learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt as a murder suspect To throw police off his track, he enters a compartment and kisses the only occupant, Pamela Madeleine Carroll, and the searchers skip the compartment She however frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen The train stops right at the Forth rail bridge from having the emergency brake triggered and Hannay jumps onto the bridge and escapes The police mount a huge effort to find him, that include his being chased from an autogyro, a precursor of the helicopterHe stays

the gun in the hand of the other thug He calls 911 on his cell phone, telling them that there's been a murder at Johnny's address When Johnny comes outside John tells him that he's staging it to

Carolina, the US Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman R Lee Ermey, whose orders are to weed out all non-hackers Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes Joker Matthew Modine a Texas recruit becomes Cowboy Arliss Howard And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes Gomer Pyle Vincent D'Onofrio, and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle coursesOne morning during muster, Hartman asks Joker if he believes in the Virgin Mary Joker responds that he doesn't, angering the Catholic drill instructor The clearly religious Hartman continues to ask Joker if he believes in the Virgin Mary, and Joker continues to resist, confirming that he doesn't because he's an atheist Despite Hartman's slapping him in the face, Joker stubbornly refuses to change his answer, stating that he belives that Hartman will only beat him harder if he reverses himself Hartman immediately promotes Joker to squad leader for having the courage to stand up to his drill instructor However, Hartman also gives Joker the difficult job of being Pyle's personal instructor Off on the sidelines over the next few days, Joker helps Pyle through the obstacle courses, shows him how to operate and clean a rifle, and how to make his bed But all of this effort is later proven to be a wasteOne evening during a routine inspection, Hartman, noticing that Pyle's foot locker is unlocked, searches it and finds a jelly doughnut food is strictly forbidden in the barracks and Pyle is not permitted to eat donuts because he's overweight Enraged, Hartman decides that from then on instead of punishing Pyle, he'll punish all the other recruits in the platoon A few nights later, the angry recruits attack Pyle with soap bars wrapped in towels while Cowboy gags him and a few others hold him down on his bed At first, Joker is reluctant to attack his friend, but after Cowboy persuades him, Joker hits Pyle longer and harder than most of the others In his bunk, Joker covers his ears, ashamed at himself for his actions, while Pyle howls in painAfter the traumatic experience, Pyle slowly begins to go insane but also shapes up and becomes the fastest and best rifleman of the entire platoon, impressing Hartman When Joker sees Pyle talking to his rifle and staring off into space blankly, and not responding to interaction, he realizes that Pyle is losing his mind Section 8, and confides in Cowboy about Pyle's growing mental breakdown By the end of basic training, Pyle clearly has been completely dehumanized by its rigorsAfter graduation, Hartman assigns each recruit a MOS Military Occupational Specialty, most of them as 0300 Infantry One exception is Joker who is assigned as a 4212 Basic Military Journalism On the platoon's last night on Parris Island, Joker draws fire watch guard patrol, during which he discovers Pyle in the bathroom loading his M-14 rifle with live ammunition Frightened, Joker attempts to calm the insane Pyle, who begins shouting, executing drill commands, and reciting the Rifleman's Creed The noise awakens Hartman, who confronts Pyle and demands that he drop the rifle When Pyle refuses and does not respond, Hartman hurls further insults at him Pyle responds by shooting Hartman dead, and then aims the rifle at Joker Joker pleads with Pyle, who lowers the rifle and nods, possibly in recognition of Joker as a friend Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himselfOne year later, Joker is in Da Nang, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes He and his partner, combat photographer Raf"

house by his rich and classy father He drives off in his fathers car, which breaks down, and Anthony is left stranded near a beach, left to sleep in a ditch over night with his belongingsThe next morning, Chicano stoner Pedo De Pacas Cheech sets off from his Mexican-family-house in his lowrider car looking for love with errands to run Pedro drives along the beach where he tries to pick up ladies, and sees Anthony with melons stuffed under his shirt Assuming that Anthony is a large-breasted woman, Pedro drives his car around and tries to pick her up, only to be horrified when he discovers Anthony is just a guy looking for a rideFeeling bad and liking that Anthony likes his car, Pedro gives Anthony a ride, just missing being caught by the police While driving, the 2 take a liking to each other being that they both like smoking marijuana Pedro offers Anthony a small joint, while Anthony shows Pedro a huge joint, made out of dog feces being that the dog ate Anthony's stash The 2 smoke the joint and get incredibly high, followed by Pedro accidentally swallowing a lot of acid The car crashes into a light pole, and the 2 are arrested and the car towed away In a small courtroom trial, the 2 are being prosecuted when Anthony, still high, begs for water Pedro grabs some of the judge's water for Anthony, only to have Anthony spit it out, revealing it to actually be vodka With the judge taken away, Pedro and Anthony are let off freeThe next morning, after Anthony meets and argues with Pedro's band being that Pedro is a guitaristsinger and Anthony is a drummer, the 2 set off to score some weed However, the town is dry being that many people are smoking pot these days The 2 visit Pedro's cousin Strawberry, who is a retired war veteran who is a little messed up in the head and has a large birth mark on his face Anthony stays in Strawberry's messy apartment while Pedro and Strawberry go off on a motorcycle to get weed While in the apartment, Anthony meets Strawberry's roommate, a cokehead who throws a large drug party in the apartment Meanwhile, Strawberry has a war flash and loses his mind and jumps off the motorcycle, sending Pedro crashing When he crashes, he sees cops hiding outside the apartment, ready to bust in and arrest the druggies at the party Pedro tries to warn Anthony via phone, which is bugged, and the party is busted Pedro infiltrates the bust dressed like a re-po man, claiming he's there to reposses the stuff The cops buy the story, and Pedro rescues AnthonyAfter that, the 2 visit Pedro's friends' place where the 2 get stoned, but not so much being that the weed is bad At that point, immigration busts in, being that Pedro's friends calling immigration on themselves to get a free ride to a wedding in Mexico Of course, Pedro and Anthony, despite their efforts to hide, get caught and deported to Tijuana as wellWhile in Tijuana, Pedro calls his uncle and gets the address of a upholestry shop and arranges to pick up a van to drive back to America But after getting fast food over the address, the 2 arrive at the wrong place- an upholestry shop which is actually a marijuana plant in disguise The factory actually makes materials out of solid and liquid marijuana, which is then smuggled across the border The marijuana-made things made there are worth up to 9 million, and is heavily watched by police, led by Sargeant Stedanko Pedro and Anthony show up to the factory, unaware of what it really is, and say they're there to pick up the van Rather than getting an actual van, the stoners get a huge green van, made from marijuana, top to bottom From the steering wheel, the tires, the doors, the gas tank, to the very structure of the van itself, its all made of pure solid and liquid marijuana- and

man himself The man being chased reaches the river and runs across a wooden boat dock but is shot twice by the man with the crossbow One of the bolts hits him in the chest, piercing his military dog tags and he falls between the slats and into the water His body is pulled from the river and one of the gang chasing him, Pik Van Cleaf, cuts a money belt from around his waist The gang's leader, Emile Fouchon, asks the man hunting the victim if the experience lived up to his expectations and the man says it hasA young woman, Natascha Nat Binder, arrives in town from Detroit looking for her father, the man who was killed by the hunters She searches for him at local missions and soup kitchens her father was an unemployed manual laborer who was also a US Army veteran Nat is unable to find out anything and goes to the French Quarter At a seedy diner, she pays for her breakfast and is careless about concealing the money she has in her wallet, which is seen by several rough-looking goons When she goes outside to her car, they attack her with the intention of robbing and raping her on the street A man named Chance Boudreaux, who was also in the diner, beats them all severely, demonstrating high skill in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts He tells Nat that she needs to be more careful in New Orleans Nat asks him to be her escort while she searches for her father Chance turns her down, saying he's a stevedore and will have to leave on a ship soonOn the New Orleans docks, Chance is being told he can't work unless he pays his back union dues Natascha arrives, looking for him and tells him she'll pay him to help her find her father Chance acceptsChance suggests they talk to the police, however Nat is reluctant since she already reported her father's disappearance and the police seemed unwilling to do very much Chance and Nat talk to a homicide detective, Marie Mitchell, who only has scattered evidence to work with, however, Nat's father's remains have been discovered in a burnt out warehouse Because he was homeless, it is assumed that he'd been squatting and was the victim of an unfortunate accident when the place burned down Chance goes there and finds one of her father's dog tags curiously, there is a hole in it which could only have been made by a sharp weapon Chance takes them back to Mitchell and Nat and tells them that Binder's death was not accidental and he was definitely shot by a sharp, edged weaponOne of the men who knew Nat's father as a veteran and from the homeless missions, Elijah Roper, reveals that Binder had been passing out fliers for a sleazy local brothel owner, Randal Poe Poe had also been working secretly with Fouchon and Pik, recruiting destitute men for their business the two give rich men the chance to hunt human

William Holden, is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list, which allows him to avoid hard labourA large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson Alec Guinness arrives, defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito Sessue Hayakawa, addresses them, informing them of his rules He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all BurmaThe next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton James Donald, a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters, the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinementWhen Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers, Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind Nicholson, however, refuses to budge, saying if we give in now there'll be no end to it In the meantime, construction of the railroad bridge falls far behind schedule, due in part to many accidents purposely arranged by the British prisonersSaito has a deadline if he should fail to meet it, it would bring him great shame and oblige him to commit seppuku ritual suicide Saito reluctantly releases Nicholson, telling him that he has proclaimed an amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War, using it as an excuse to exempt the officers from work Upon their release, Nicholson and his officers proudly walk through a jubilant reception Saito for his part breaks down in tears in privateHaving recovered from his ordeal physically, but not mentally broken, Nicholson sets off on an inspection of the bridge and is shocked to find disorganization, shirking and outright sabotage on the construction site He decides that he will build a better bridge than the Japanese soldiers He orders Captain Reeves Peter Williams and Major Hughes John Boxer to come up with designs for a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese He wants to demonstrate to his captors what he considers superior British ingenuity and to also keep his men busy, which he feels would be better for morale than sitting around doing nothing in prisonMeanwhile, three men, one of them the American Shears, attempt to escape Two are killed Shears is shot, falls into the river and is swept downstream After many days in the jungle, he stumbles into a Siamese village, whose residents help him recover and get back to safety He's given food, water and an outrigger boat to make his way down the river Shears runs out of water during the trip and is forced to drink the water from the river, which makes him ill However, he makes it to the mouth of the river and is picked up by British forces and

telephones until his 18th birthdayShortly before Dade Jonny Lee Miller turns 18, his mother now divorced takes a job in New York City Upon turning 18, Dade calls a local television station, dupes the security guard into giving him the modem's phone number a tactic known as social engineering and successfully hacks into the station's computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of The Outer Limits However, Dade is attacked by a hacker handle Acid Burn on the same network During the conversation, Dade identifies himself by the new alias, Crash OverrideDade enrolls at Stanton High School, where he meets Kate Libby Angelina Jolie, who is assigned to take him on a tour of the school After Dade learns that Kate is Acid Burn, a feud erupts between themThe real trouble begins when Joey Pardella Jesse Bradford, the novice hacker of the group, successfully breaks into an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer to prove to the rest of the group that he is an elite hacker To validate this feat, he downloads part of a garbage file Unfortunately, the company's IT employee Hal Penn Jillette detects this unauthorized entry and summons computer security officer Eugene The Plague Belford Fisher Stevens to deal with the problem He realizes the file being downloaded can prove that The Plague is stealing from the company via salami slicing The Plague enlists the US Secret Service to recover the file by claiming that it is the code to Da Vinci, a computer virus that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet and he needs that code to destroy the virusJoey is arrested and his computer is searched, but the Secret Service finds nothing, as Joey has hidden the disk containing the files In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a hacking

boy's bathroom at school That evening, Kate and Cereal Killer ask Dade for his help but, because of his record, he declines Kate then asks Dade to copy the disk so that, if anyone else is arrested, they have the disk as evidenceAfter determining that Dade is not the one who hacked into Ellingson, The Plague attempts to enlist Dade's help to find the one who did First, he offers Dade a free high-powered laptop Later, he threatens to have Dade's mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate's copy of the diskMeanwhile, Kate, Lord Nikon, and

commit on legal technicalties One day, Vail sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler Edward Norton, a young, stuttering, simpleton altar boy accused of murdering the beloved and hightly respected Archbishop Rushman Stanley Anderson of the Catholic Church in Chicago As a result, Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro-bonoAt first, the spotlight-loving Vail is interested primarily in the publicity that the case will bring, yet during his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is truly innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor and Vail's former lover, Janet Venable Laura LinneyAs the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt District Attorney John Shaughnessy John Mahoney as well as the mayor and even the regional governor, have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result Vail also learns through the grapevine that the archbishop had been sexually abusing altar boys, including StamplerIntroducing this evidence, while it would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, would also give his client a motive for murder, something the prosecution otherwise has lackedThe trial does not proceed well for the defense, as there is considerable evidence against Stampler since he was found running from the crime scene of the Archbishop's apartment with blood splattered all over his clothes, and he claims not to remember anything about the murder However, public opinion holds Stampler almost certainly guilty and there are denials by the public about the Archbishop's true nature of being a pedophileAfter Vail sneaks into the Archbishop's apartment to look for more evidence, he finds a pornographic videotape of Aaron Stampler with another alter boy and a teenage girl, named Linda, performing in sexual acts while the Archbishop is behind the camera filming everything Vail anonymously sends a copy of it to Janet knowing that she will introduce it as evidence, against the advice of DA John Shaughnessy who wants to keep his dirty dealings with Archbishop Rushman hidden at any costWhen Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Aaron breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona a violent, foul-mouthed sociopath who calls himself Roy He confesses to the murder of the Archbishop for the years of molestation and abuse Roy then throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell, injuring him When this incident is over, Aaron Stampler reemerges and appears to have no recollection of it Molly Arrington Frances McDormand, the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced he suffers from multiple personality disorder due to childhood abuse by his own father, in which apparently resurfaced following the molestation of the Archbishop upon him However, Vail realizes that he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trialAs a result, Vail begins to sets up a confrontation in court by dropping hints about the Archbishop's true nature as well as Aaron's multi-personality disorder At the climax, Vail puts Aaron on the witness stand where he gently probes him in direct examination over his unhappy childhood and troubled dealings with the Archbishop During cross-examination, after Janet Venable questions him harshly, Aaron turns into Roy in open court and charges at her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him Aaron is subdued by courthouse marshals and is rushed back to his holding cellIn light of Aaron's apparent insanity, the judge Alfre Woodard dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Aaron not guilty by reason of mental insanity, and remands him to a maximum securit"

cut from the theatrical version of the film but restored for the 2003 DVD Assembly Cut appear in red Scenes that appear only in the Theatrical Version and no longer in the Assembly Cut appear in blueIn the opening credits of the film, the Sulaco, the large military ship carrying the survivors from the mission to LV-426 as seen in the movie Aliens, is en route to Earth Newt, Hicks, Ripley Sigourney Weaver, and the remains of the android Bishop Lance Henriksen are all safely in hypersleep However, a stowaway Alien egg on the ship has released a facehugger It breaks the glass of one of the tubes, wounding itself Acid dripping from the facehugger starts an electrical fire, and the ship responds automatically The medical scanner shows the facehugger as it is attached to one of the sleeping figures Unable to contain the fire, the automated systems of the Sulaco eject all the cryotubes into an escape pod and eject the pod into outer space The navigation systems lead the escape vehicle to the nearest planet, which happens to be Fiorina Fury 161, home to a penal colony populated by life-sentence XYY-chromosome prisoners, all of whom are multiple murderers and rapists Unsurprisingly, it is owned and operated by Weyland-Yutani, the omnipresent company that employed Ripley The EEV crash lands in the water near the shoreA man, Dr Clemens Charles Dance, wanders alone along the shoreline when he sees a strange figure lying on the beach It is Ripley, covered in mud and barely alive Clemens takes her inside and warns the prisoners that an EEV has crash-landed, and that they need to extract it from the water quickly He performs CPR on Ripley, who starts breathing again In the meanwhile, the prisoners use oxen to pull the remains of the EEV from the water Superintendent Andrews Brian Glover prepares a message to the Company Message screens read that the EEV has been salvaged, but the young female Newt has drowned, Corporal Hicks is dead, and Bishop is damaged beyond repair Ripley is the only survivor as she receives immediate care at the infirmary The prisoners tow the wreckage back to the prison by crane Spike, the Rottweiler belonging to one of the inmates, barks fiercely at a facehugger that is still inside the EEV that goes unnoticed by the prison crewMr Aaron Ralph Brown, Andrews' assistant, assembles the inmates as they go into prayer In an attempt to prevent rumours from spreading, director Andrews Brian Glover announces the news to the prison population, making note that the only survivor of the EEV crash is a woman Two prisoners, Morse Danny Webb and Dillon Charles S Dutton, the spiritual leader of the prisoners, view the presence of a woman to be disruptive in the all-male population, out of concern for the spiritual well-being of their brothers, many of whom have adopted a fundamentalist, millenarian denomination of Christianity and have vowed celibacy Andrews assures them that he has requested a Company rescue team to pick her up He leaves Ripley in the care of doctor Clemens Charles Dance, under orders that she's not to leave the infirmary until the rescue ship arrives for herRipley awakens from hypersleep and is disoriented, but Clemens stabilizes her with an injection She is distraught to learn of her circumstances, especially the news that her companions are dead She demands that Clemens take her to the wreckage of the EEV He takes her through the blast furnace to the EEV and explains that the prison once accommodated 5000 inmates, but has since been reduced to a custodial staff of 25, to keep the furnace functioning She hears that Hicks got hit by a support beam upon impact, and was instantly killed Bishop was lying around in pieces what was left of him was dumped on the trash heap The news that Newt drowned in her cryotube after the ship crashed makes her break down in tears, despite Clemens' assurance that Newt probably wasn't conscious when it happened Before she can process the

amputated Seeing the plight of fellow soldiers with amputated legs, Dunbar refuses amputation and attempts suicide by riding a horse across the line of fire, between the opposing Union and Confederate positions His action has the unexpected effect of rallying his comrades, who storm the distracted Confederates and win the battle After the ensuing battle, an experienced general's surgeon saves Dunbar's leg The commanding officer recognizes Dunbar as a hero and gives him Cisco, the horse who carried him in battle, and offers Dunbar his choice of postingDunbar, anxious to see the Western frontier before it ends, requests transfer west After meeting with Major Fambrough Maury Chaykin, who has slipped into delusions of grandeur apparently believing he is a king and Dunbar a medieval knight, he is paired with a drayage teamster named Timmons Robert Pastorelli, who conveys Dunbar to his post After the departure of Timmons and Dunbar, Fambrough commits suicide with his own pistolAfter a scenic journey, Dunbar and Timmons arrive with fresh supplies at the desolate Fort Sedgwick, finding it deserted except for a lone wolf that Dunbar later befriends and dubs Two Socks, because of the coloring of its front legs Dunbar, while waiting for reinforcements to arrive, sets about bringing order the deserted post, left in complete disarray by its previous occupants Meanwhile, Timmons, while returning to their point of departure, is ambushed by Pawnee Indians and scalped Timmons' death and the suicide of the major who sent them there prevents Union officers from knowing of Dunbar's assignment to the post, effectively isolating Dunbar Dunbar remains unaware of the full situation and its implications He notes in his journal how strange it is that no more soldiers join him at the postDunbar initially encounters Sioux neighbors when the tribe's medicine man, Kicking Bird Graham Greene, happens upon the fort while Dunbar bathes out of sight, and, assuming it abandoned, attempts to capture Cisco After Dunbar scares off Kicking Bird, he is confronted by an aggressive warrior named Wind in His Hair Rodney A Grant, who declares that he is not scared of the white man Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, but the language barrier frustrates them On his way to visit the tribe's camp, Dunbar interrupts the suicide attempt of Stands With A Fist Mary McDonnell, a white woman captured by the tribe as a child and recently widowed, who recovers and acts as a translator Dunbar finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe, and becomes a hero among the Sioux and accepted as an honorary member of the tribe after he helps them locate a migrating herd of buffalo, which they depend upon as a source of food, material, and clothingDunbar further helps defend the settlement against a Pawnee raiding party, providing the Sioux warriors with surplus rifles and ammunition from the fort He eventually is accepted as a full member of the tribe After members of the tribe witness him playing with Two Socks, he is named ugmnitu Taka Ob'wahi Dances with Wolves ugmnitu Taka means large coyote, the Lakota word for wolf Dunbar falls in love with Stands With A Fist, a relationship forbidden by the recent death of her husband in battle but consummated in secret The two eventually win the approval of Kicking Bird, who takes on the role of her father, and marry Dunbar subsequently spends more time living with the tribe than manning his post at Fort Sedgwick Wind In His Hair, his last rival, acknowledges him as a friendDunbar's idyll ends when he tells Kicking Bird that white men will continue to invade their land in numbers like the stars They tell Chief Ten Bears Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman, who decides it is

dreamsThe problem was, there was always a little daylight between his dreams and his wallet See, he was a working stiff, 56 grand a year and never made it past Sergeant And, every day he looked at a little of this, We see Jack responding to a grisly murder scene and then he looked at too much of that We see Jack on a stakeout watching a guy having sex with two girls And all the time he was thinking, huh, I bet you know what he was thinking, dontcha you'd a done just what he wound up doin' I'll bet He walked around just like everybody, but inside, he wasn't like anybodyWe see Jack come home to his wife and dancing with her in the yard until late in the night, as Doherty tells us she was his true love and he could've told her anything We then flash forward to see Grimaldi trying to

want him to be It is now 1880The town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming is ruled rather arbitrarily by a sheriff named Little Bill Daggett Gene Hackman Two cowboys, Davey Rob Campbell and Mike David Mucci are spending their leave at a brothel owned by Skinny Dubois Anthony James One of the women, Delilah, makes an offhanded comment that Mike perceives as an insult, so he attacks her with a knife, scarring her face Skinny and the de facto madam, Strawberry Alice Frances Fisher hold them until Little Bill can arrive The women want Davey and Mike to hang, but Little Bill decides that since they did not murder Delilah, they should be horse-whipped instead However, Skinny is more concerned with potential loss of business due to Delilah's disfigurement So Little Bill decrees that instead of being horsewhipped, the men will have to give Skinny some horses This outrages the women even more, and afterward they meet privately and pool all their resources to offer a reward to anyone who will kill the two attackersWe meet Munny on his farm trying to deal with some sick hogs It quickly becomes clear that he is not a very good hog farmer, as he repeatedly falls in the mud when trying to grab a hog In the midst of this he has a visitor, a young man calling himself the Scofield Kid Jaimz Woolvett, who knows Munny by reputation and would like his help in killing Davey and Mike in return for half the reward money Munny makes it clear that he is not interested because, since marrying his late wife, he doesn't do the things he used to do anymore But after the Kid leaves, Munny goes back to his bumbling attempts at tending hogs, and begins to have second thoughts He sets a can on a tree stump and begins firing at it with his pistol, without hitting it Finally he goes in the house and gets his rifle, and blows the can away on the first shotBack in Big Whiskey, Davey and Mike show up with the horses for Skinny The women throw stones and horse manure at them Mike has never shown any remorse at any point, but Davey seems genuinely sorry about what happened to Delilah He pointedly tells Skinny that one of the horses is not for him, and then offers it to Delilah The women only throw

seven-year-old spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances happily in a tutu Their mother Angela Pietropinto is a shrewish, overbearing woman who dotes on Missy and always sides with her in disputes with Dawn Their father is a meek, selfish businessman who always sides with Dawn's mother Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy Dimitri DeFresco, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyardDawn's life in junior high is even more miserable all of classmates call her names and cover her locker with derisive graffiti, the cheerleaders call her a lesbian, an abrasive teacher unfairly keeps her after school one day for no reason, another girl forces her to use the toilet while the girl watches, and she is threatened with rape by a bully

calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her considering that Missy is never friendly towards Dawn The next day at school, Dawn accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball and she gets suspended for three days Dawn's stupid and ignorant parents continue to be unsure of what is causing her rude behavior and Dawn refuses to talk to them about her hellish life at school, aware that they will not understandBrandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails when he does not seem to force himself upon her, but he orders her to meet him again the next day after school After she presents herself to him and he takes her to an abandoned field, he starts an earnest conversation and only kisses her, even though she is obviously willing Brandon is clearly not the bad

rulerDuring the battle, a caption says the movie takes place in England in the year 984 ADBowen is separated from Einon when the youth rushes off as his father, who brazenly rode off alone to set fire to huts and homes, is surrounded by peasants in an ambush Freyne is dismounted and killed When the villagers disperse, Einon rushes from a hiding place and takes the crown off his father's head Freyne, who isn't quite dead yet, grabs at Einon who struggles free, yelling, It's mine In the confusion, a young girl Sandra Kovacicova wearing a bucket on her head as a helmet, falls off of the balcony of a smoking hut and knocks Einon into a spiked post which pierces through his chest, grievously wounding him The girl takes off her helm to reveal long red hair They look at each other for a

hidden in shadow When he sees the severity of Einon's wound, he is reluctant to help and warns Aislinn the consequences of what must be done to save him Aislinn assures the dragon that Einon is not like his father and vows to ensure that he grows up to be a fine leader and role model for his people, but the dragon insists that Einon swear to all this himself Einon swears by the dragon just as he breathes his last Bowen angrily shouts at the dragon but is reprimanded as the dragon opens a chest plate and removes half his heart, placing it in Einon's chest He then seals the wound with a blast of fire As Einon wakes up, he commands the boy to do as he promised Aislinn kneels before the dragon in gratitude, and Bowen promises to repay the favor any way he can, any time in the future when the

film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phasesIn the first phase, set in the late 1930s, the minor Hungarian noble Count Laszlo de Almsy Ralph Fiennes is co-leader of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition in Egypt and Libya He and his English partner Madox Julian Wadham are at heart academics with limited sophistication in the swirling politics of Europe and North Africa Shortly after the film begins, both the morale and finances of their expedition are bolstered by a British couple, Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton Colin Firth and Kristin Scott Thomas that joins the exploration party The Count is taken with the gorgeous and refined Katherine When Geoffrey is often away from the group on other matters, an affair takes wingThe final months before the war's onset bring an archaeological triumph the Count's discovery of an ancient Saharan cave decorated with swimming figure paintings dating from prehistoric times This period also sees the romance between Katherine and the Count rise to a sensuous peak and then seemingly fade Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt himThe fall of 1939 and the war bring all excavation at the cave to a halt, and Madox and the Count go their separate ways Geoffrey Clifton meanwhile has pieced together the outline of the affair, and seeks a sudden and dramatic revenge crashing his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp The wreck kills Geoffrey instantly, seriously injures Katherine, and narrowly misses the Count He manages to take Katherine into the relative shelter of the swimming figure cave, leaves her with water, a flashlight, and a fire, then begins his scorching three day walk back to Cairo and help The mood in British-controlled Egypt has shifted since the films start and the dazed and dehydrated Count, with his non-English name, is unable to coherently explain to officials the plane crash and Katherine's plight Instead he loses his temper during questioning and is thrown into military jail By the time he is able to escape and return to the cave with German help, his Katherine is dead And in all but a physical sense, so is the CountThe films second phase shifts to Italy and the last months of the war The Count by now is an invalid, having been horribly burned in a plane crash of his own not long after Katherine's death The Count is wholly dependent by this time on morphine and the care of his French-Canadian nurse Hana Juliette Binoche, detached from her medical unit and established in a battered but beautiful Italian villaThe villa becomes focal point for more plot threads, some new and some unfinished from the North African phase, all themed around love, fate, and the backdrop of the war Hana has seen a fianc and a nursing friend die in the Italian campaign, and is left to wonder if her involvement with a British-Indian lieutenant will break her cycle of love and grief or simply continue it A visitor to the villa named David Caravaggio Willem Dafoe at first believes he has simply found another source of morphine for his habit, but then realizes the disfigured Count played a role in his own ill-starred time in Egypt and Libya For Caravaggio unwittingly stumbled into the wreckage of the Count-Katherine-Geoffrey love triangle, circa 1940-42 He's lost both thumbs in a grisly interrogation at the hands of the Nazis, and has since hunted down and killed those he believes responsible for his fate He believes the Count was part of a web of spying and intrigue, confronts him with news of Madox's suicide, and posits that the Count killed the Cliftons Only a full recounting at the villa of the Cliftons' crash and the Count's map dealings with the Germans to recover Katherine bring Car"

living in San Francisco, California, who quits his job at an animation studio over a questionable script Though a devoted and well-meaning father to his three young children, Lydia, Chris and Natalie, Daniel is an unreliable husband When Daniel throws a boisterous birthday party for his son Chris, despite his wife, Miranda, saying he couldn't have one because of his bad report card, Miranda becomes furious with him and seeks a divorce At their first custody hearing, the judge grants Miranda custody of the children, since Daniel has neither a residence nor a jobDaniel soon learns that Miranda intends to hire a housekeeper and surreptitiously alters her classifieds form when she refuses to let him take care of the children He then calls Miranda several times, using his voice acting to trick her into thinking that terrible job applicants are calling He then calls as a British-accented3 nanny, whom he dubs Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire Impressed with her alleged qualifications, Miranda invites Mrs Doubtfire for an interview Daniel enlists his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and his partner Jack to transform him into the characterAfter being further impressed by the interview, Miranda hires Mrs Doubtfire The children initially struggle to adjust to Mrs Doubtfire's strict methods, but they soon begin to thrive, becoming happier and doing better in school, while Miranda is able to heal her distant relationship with her children and she and Mrs Doubtfire become good friends Daniel has to learn several skills to play the role convincingly, such as cooking and cleaning, and also improves himself However, despite impressing Miranda greatly with his newfound maturity, Daniel realizes he has indirectly created another barrier, as when he asks to look after the children, Miranda insists she could never dismiss Mrs Doubtfire, as the family's lives have been made so much better by her One night, Chris and Lydia learn that Mrs Doubtfire is their father in disguise, but after the initial panic and learning why he did it, agree to keep it a secret from everyoneDaniel also takes a job at a TV station CEO Jonathan Lundy sees Daniel clowning around with toy dinosaurs on the set of an unsuccessful children's program on the cusp of cancellation Impressed with Daniel's creativity, Lundy invites him to dinner at Bridge's Restaurant on the coming Friday night in order for Daniel to pitch ideas as a new host Miranda, meanwhile, expects Mrs Doubtfire to attend a birthday dinner arranged by romantic interest Stuart Dunmire scheduled at the same time and placeUnable to reschedule either appointment, Daniel goes to the restaurant and tries to rotate between both dinners, changing in and out of the Mrs Doubtfire costume in the restroom He consumes several alcoholic beverages between the two tables and becomes tipsy He forgets to change out of the Mrs Doubtfire costume before returning to Lundy's table and seasons pepper an ingredient Stuart is allergic to on Stuart's order When Lundy questions the costume, Daniel covers for his mistake by explaining that his alter ego is his idea for a television persona, impressing Lundy At Miranda's table, Stuart starts choking on the pepper Out of regret, Daniel, still in the Mrs Doubtfire costume, administers the Heimlich maneuver During the struggle, Daniel's mask rips off, revealing his identity Horrified and furious, Miranda storms out of the restaurant with the childrenAt their next custody hearing, despite Daniel demonstrating he has a job and a suitable home, the judge, although sympathetic, is disturbed by Daniel's behavior and grants Miranda full custody, with Daniel limited to supervised visitation once a week Without Mrs Doubtfire, the children again become withdrawn and depressed, and even Miranda admits their lives were so much better with her However, they are delighted when they see Daniel dressed as Mrs Doubtfire hosting his own television program, Euphegenia's House, which become"

special Stalag, or prison camp, designed to house their most troublesome inmates, the ones who make repeated escape attempts Arriving at the new camp, many begin immediately to asses its security and figure out how to get away One American prisoner, Capt Hilts Steve McQueen casually tosses his ever-present baseball into a perceived blind spot between the guard towers in order to test the Germans, and stepping over the warning wire gets a few machine-gun bullets fired at his feet Others try different escape tactics several hide themselves in trucks full of brush as they drive towards the gate, and two of the men even try inflitrating a group of Russian workers marching out of the camp All are quickly found and rooted out, with Hilts being thrown into the Cooler, a isolation cell at the far side of the camp All this in the first 20 minutes after they arriveAfter the initial excitement, the POW's begin to make more cohesive plans The ranking officer of the group, Capt Ramsey James Donald has a meeting with the German Commandant, who assures him escape is impossible, and it would be in everyone's best interest if they would all accept their situation, settle down, and sit out the remainder of the war as comfortably as possible Ramsey must however remind the Commandant that it is the sworn duty of all the prisoners to create as much trouble for the Germans as they can, and politely leavesBetween them, the POW's have considerable experience in tunneling, and have made many escape attempts Sqdn Leader Bartlet Richard Attenborough quickly organizes everyone into teams and get them all to work Some, like Lt Tunnel King Velinski Charles Bronson begin digging, while Lt Scrounger Hendley James Garner begins to gather the materials needed to make everything workAfter a couple of weeks in the cooler, Hilts is released and meets with the others, who are working on plans to dig three tunnels under the fence Hilts has his own plan to dig out, a idea that is so simple it just might work, and he intends to try it that night Wishing him the best, the main team realizes that Hilts may not succeed, but he'll at least distract the Germans from the other attempts Hilts starts under the fence that night, but the next morning he's back in the cooler again, bouncing his baseball off the wallOther prisoners are working on the main escape attempt Lt Blythe Donald Pleasence is the forger of the group, and works on fake ID papers, while the Aussie Sedgwick James Coburn creates amazing tools from scrap metal scavanged around the camp Lt Pitt David McCallum has figured out a way to get rid of all the dirt they're bringing up out of the tunnels, and everything seems to be moving forward Bartlet has made up his mind that this will be the greatest escape of the war, and plans to get every single POW out in one big night, all 250 menConstant inspections by the suspicious Germans hinder their progress, but the tunnels grow a few feet longer every night, and the men get closer to their goal Hilts, finally out of the cooler again, begins to brew a strange concoction from potatoes, and on the 4th of July surprises everyone with gallons secretly distilled alcohol A much-needed party breaks out as the POW's gather outside for a few drinks Inside however, the guards have found a hidden hatch under a wood stove that leads to the main tunnel, and at the height of their celebration the men are suddenly crushed to learn that their greatest hope of escape is now gone, including Ives, a British officer and friend of Hiltz while they were in the cooler who had been slowly losing hope and beginning to crack, finally cracks and runs for the fences only to be shot Bitterly resigned, Bartley tersely tells the men to continue quietly on tunnel 2Hilts has

faithfulnessThe next morning, a mysterious package arrives on the front doorstep containing a videotape Renee doesn't mention the tape, but Fred sees it and demands that they watch it The tape only displays a 20-second image of the outside of their home The relieved Renee tells a perplexed Fred that the tape might have been from a real estate agentOne night Fred tries to make love to Renee, but gives up in failure, humiliated when she pats him on the back and dispassionately consoles him He tells her about a dream he had she was crying out for him, Fred, where are you He couldn't find her and says that he saw someone in bed that looked like her but wasn't her The Renee in the dream screams in terror as Fred approaches her in bed Fred then seems to wake up in bed lying next to Renee, but when he turns to look at her, he sees not her face but the pale, frightening looking face of a man superimposed on her silhouette Bill startles out of the nightmare, now fully awake for realAs the days pass, a second tape arrives, showing the interior of their house-- the unseen intruder also films them in bed, sleeping Fred and Renee call the police Two detectives, Al and Ed John Roselius and Louis Eppolito, watch the video They recommend that Fred and Renee resume using their security system, and search the house for signs of forced entry The departing cops say We'll keep watch over the house We'll do the best we can, having neither found nor resolved anythingThat evening, Fred and Renee go out to a party held by Andy Michael Massee an old friend of Renee's Renee drunkenly stumbles, giggling, into Andy's arms while pleading with Fred to get her another drink A jealous Fred goes to the bar for a drink where he meets a Mystery Man Robert Blake, who tells Fred that they've met before and that he is at his house right now It was in fact the face of the Mystery Man that Fred saw in place of Renee's in his nightmare Fred phones his house and the voice of the Mystery Man answers at the house while he's standing right in front of Fred Shaken, Fred asks Andy who the Mystery Man is and is told that he is a friend of Dick Laurent When Fred repeats the message he heard on the intercom, that Dick Laurent is dead, Andy nervously asks how Fred knows Dick Laurent and insists that Dick can't be dead Fred then forcibly grabs Renee and they leave the partyDriving home, Fred questions Renee about Andy and her past connection to him Renee answers vaguely, failing to alleviate Fred's jealous suspicions Arriving back at their house, Fred makes Renee wait in the driveway while he checks inside for intruders and finds no one While Renee prepares for bed and removes her makeup in the bathroom, Fred walks around the dimly lit house and finds himself standing in front of a dark hallway Fred walks down the hallway and disappears, eventually encountering a mirror reflection of himself Renee walks out of the bedroom and stands at the base of the hallway She calls out for

injured in the battle and assumed lost, but is found alive by a gravedigger named John Rawlins Morgan Freeman and sent to a field hospital While on medical leave in Boston, Shaw visits his family, and is introduced to Frederick Douglass Shaw is offered a promotion to the rank of Colonel, and command of the first all-black regiment the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry He accepts the responsibility, and asks his childhood friend, Major Cabot Forbes Cary Elwes to serve as his second in command Their first volunteer soldier is another one of Shaw's friends, a bookish freeman named Thomas Searles Andre Braugher Other recruits soon follow, including Rawlins, timid freeman Jupiter Jihmi Kennedy, and Trip Denzel Washington, an escaped slave who is mistrustful of Shaw Trip instantly clashes with Thomas, and Rawlins must keep the peaceWhen the Confederacy issues an order that all black soldiers found in Union uniform will be summarily executed as will their white officers, the opportunity is given to all men in the 54th to take a honorable discharge, but none do The black soldiers undergo a Draconian training regimen under the harsh supervision of Sgt Mulcahy John Finn Forbes and Shaw argue over the brutality of the training, as the former believes they will never be allowed to fight and will only be used as a manual labor forceWhen Trip goes AWOL and is caught, Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops The scars of his previous beatings as a slave are exposed and this presents a real dilemma for the abolitionist Shaw While talking to Rawlins, Shaw finds out that Trip had left merely to find suitable shoes to replace his own worn ones Shaw realizes that supplies are being denied to his soldiers because of their race He belligerently confronts the quartermaster, Kendric Richard Riehle, and finds out that indeed shoes and socks were in stock but had not been given to the black soldiers His advocacy on behalf of his soldiers continues through a pay dispute during which the Federal government decided to pay black soldiers less than white soldiersOnce the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General Charles Garrison Harker Bob Gunton On the way to joining the war in South Carolina, the 54th is ordered to sack a Georgia town and burn it by Harker's second-in-command, Colonel Montgomery Cliff De Young After first refusing, he obeys the order and the town is destroyed Shaw continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight All their duties since being activated involved building and manual labor Shaw invests Rawlins as a Sergeant Major and Rawlins begins the difficult task of earning respect from both the white and black soldiersShaw confronts Harker and threatens to report the smuggling, looting, and graft he has discovered unless Harker orders the 54th into combat In their first battle on James Island, South Carolina, early success is followed by a bloody confrontation with many casualties However, the Confederates are beaten and retreat During the battle,Thomas is wounded but saves Trip, finally earning the respect of the former slave He subsequently refuses to go home to recoverSome time after, General George Strong Jay O Sanders informs Shaw and his superiors of a major campaign to secure a foothold in Charleston Harbor This will involve assaulting the nearby Morris Island and capturing its impenetrable fortress, Battery WagnerThe fort's only landward approach is via a small strip of beach with little cover, and the first regiment to charge is sure to suffer extremely heavy casualties Shaw volunteers to have the 54th lead the chargeThe night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service where individual soldiers offer their

September 1967 Upon arrival in Da Nang, South Vietnam, he sees dead soldiers in body bags being loaded into his plane, but more distressing to him is the shellshocked state of a departing soldier with the thousand-yard stare Taylor and several other replacements have been assigned to Bravo Company, 25th Infantry division, somewhere near the Cambodian border Worn down by the exhausting work and living conditions, his enthusiasm for the war wanes quickly and he develops an admiration for the more experienced soldiers, despite their reluctance to extend their friendshipOne day, another new arrival, platoon commander Lieutenant Wolfe Mark Moses discusses the plans for a patrol later that night with the platoon sergeants the compassionate Sergeant Elias Willem Dafoe, harsh but hard core Staff Sergeant Barnes Tom Berenger, cowardly, sycophantic lifer Sergeant Red O'Neil John C McGinley, and drug addict Sergeant Warren Tony Todd Barnes and Elias argue over whether to send the new men out on a patrol that is likely to be ambushed O'Neil insists that the new troops go out instead of several men under him who are nearly finished with their tours of duty Barnes agrees, only on the condition that O'Neil goes out as wellThat night, North Vietnamese soldiers set upon Taylor's sleeping unit Gardner Bob Orwig, a fellow new recruit, is killed, and another soldier, Tex David Neidorf, is maimed Despite having passed the watch duty to Junior Reggie Johnson, a more experienced but consistently irresponsible soldier who fell asleep, Taylor is blamed for the casualties O'Neil is also to blame, having thrown the grenade that maimed Tex Immediately after the fighting, Taylor discovers a light wound to his neck, and he is sent to the field hospital for treatmentA few days later, Taylor returns to his unit from the hospital and, through a soldier named King Keith David, gains acceptance from the heads, a tight-knit group led by Elias that socializes, dances, and takes drugs in a private bunker Next door, Barnes leads the more traditional members of the unit whom drink beer and play cards and don't smoke marijuana Taylor becomes a more seasoned soldier as the patrols

sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors Bill Murray, news producer Rita Andie MacDowell and cameraman Larry Chris Elliott from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil grudgingly gives his report during the festival and paradeAfter the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney Connors awakens the next morning, however, to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 600 AM, when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast His clock radio is always playing the same song, Sonny Cher's I Got You Babe His memories of the previous day are intact, but he's trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small townAfter briefly trying to rationalize his situation, and then thinking he is insane, Connors takes advantage of learning the day's events and the information he is able to gather about the town's inhabitants, and finds that his actions have no long-term consequences for himself He revels in this situation for a time seducing beautiful women, stealing money, even driving drunk and experiencing a police chase However, his attempts to seduce his producer, Rita, are met with repeated failures He begins to tire of, and then dread, his existence, starting the day by smashing the alarm clock and professing the inanity of Groundhog Day as a holiday in his newscast In a vain attempt to break the cycle, he kidnaps Phil the Groundhog After a police pursuit, Connors drives a stolen truck into a quarry, causing both man and rodent to die in a fiery explosion but the loop does not stop He commits suicide several more times He electrocutes himself, lets a truck hit him on the road, and jumps from a tall building other attempts are alluded to but mere death cannot stop the day from repeating After he dies, he simply wakes up listening to Sonny Cher in the same bed, on the same day, over and over againHe initially tries to seduce Rita by learning as much as he can on a daily basis First he asks what she wants in a man someone who is humble, kind, generous, courageous, and sensitive someone who likes children someone who loves his mother and plays a musical instrument He learns what she likes rocky road ice cream, sweet vermouth, French poetry and what she doesn't like white chocolate and pretends to share her tastes This also fails consistently in scene after scene, Rita slaps him before the night is over However, he is able to befriend her in a more sincere fashion He tells her of his circumstances -- how he is reliving the day over and over again -- and manages to convince her of the truth with his extensive knowledge of events to come, the lives of the Punxsutawney townspeople, and Rita herselfHe opens his heart to Rita, and her advice helps him to gradually find a goal for his trapped life as a benefactor to others He cannot, in a single day, bring others to fulfill his needs but he can achieve self-improvement by educating himself on a daily basis After seeing an elderly homeless man die, Connors vows that no one will die on his day and performs many heroic services each and every repeating day, including performing the Heimlich maneuver on a choking man and saving a little boy who falls from a tree However, he becomes despondent

movie opens, we see a guy climbing along the underside of an outcropping from a tall mountain peak He turns out to be Gabe Walker, a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue Yes, that makes him Ranger Walker, and he is addressed as such several times during the course of the movie He is in communication with his co-worker and girlfriend, Jessie, who is on a chopper piloted by an older co-worker, Frank The three are mounting a rescue of yet another co-worker, Hal Tucker, and his girlfriend Sarah, who is on her first climb Hal and Sarah made it to the top of the mountain, but Hal has aggravated an old knee injury and can't make it back downGabe makes it to the top of the peak where Hal and Sarah are The chopper drops Gabe a cable, which he secures, while the chopper lands on a nearby peak All is set for the three to shuttle across the cable to where the chopper is There is a lot of light-hearted banter as this is a routine operation that they all except Sarah do all the time Hal goes first, and as he is crossing, Gabe asks Sarah how Hal persuaded her to accompany him on this escapade She replies laconically, He told me it's better than sexHal makes it across and now it's Sarah's turn She is a little frightened at the thought of hanging from a cable 4,000 feet above the ground, but the fact that Hal crossed without incident is reassuring Halfway across her equipment fails and suddenly she is hanging by a strap and unable to reach and grab onto the cable Gabe quickly crosses to her and grabs her arm just as the strap breaks free But they are unable to keep their grip on each other, and Sarah falls 4,000 feet to her death This is by far the most dramatic and gripping scene in the movie and some viewers will be haunted by it for weeks afterwards But really, except for providing some background for the interpersonal dynamics among the remaining characters, it has nothing to do with the plot of the rest of the movieFast forward eight months, and we pick up two different plot lines that will converge later At the US Treasury office in Denver, Treasury Agent Travers is preparing to leave on a flight with several large containers of printed currency totaling 100,000,000 His boss introduces FBI Agent Matheson, who is being transferred and is bumming a ride on the flight Gabe, meanwhile, drives up to Jessie's and formerly his house He had left after Sarah's funeral because he felt he had to get away, and has been working in Denver He wants Jessie to come to Denver with him, but she won't She leaves for work, leaving Gabe to get his stuff from the house and load it into his vehicleOn the plane, Matheson looks out his window and sees another plane flying next to them He quickly and correctly sizes up the situation, informs the other two Treasury agents that Travers intends to hijack the plane, and pulls his gun on Travers The other two agents dutifully pull their guns on Matheson, as does Travers Travers shoots the other two agents, then shoots Matheson In the cockpit, the co-pilot comments about the gunfire, and the pilot shoots him The two planes move into position and run a cable between them Travers transfers over, then the pilot sends the containersBut Matheson isn't dead He manages to shoot the pilot, shoot the cable in enough places that it detaches from both planes and the containers fall to the ground, and shoot the other plane enough times that it crashes in the mountains, before his own plane explodes from explosives previously set by Travers Kristel, the pilot of the other plane, radios for help, reaches Jessie, Hal, and Frank, tells them they are hikers who got lost in a snowstorm, and asks them to send a chopper But they can't send a chopper because of the storm, so Hal sets off to climb to their

and some tapirs compete for the meagre green plants A leopard attacks an ape While one group of apes is drinking at a waterhole, another group approaches the two groups scream at each other and one party is driven off At night the apes huddle in fear among the rocks In the morning a tall, thin, rectangular black monolith stands among the rocks The apes are excited but touch the object and calm down Soundtrack Gyrgy Ligeti's RequiemAn ape Daniel Richter lifts a femur bone from a skeletal pile and realizes it makes a fine weapon Soundtrack Thus Spake Zarathustra again The ape realizes that it

preparing a meal and listening to the radio Her fourteen year old daughter Jenny Agutter and six year old son Luc Roeg swim in the building's pool overlooking a view of the ocean while their father John Meillon, deep in troubled thought, watches them from their balconyOne day, the father takes his children, still in their school uniforms, on a picnic into the Outback He parks the car and reads while his daughter sets up a blanket with their lunch Her brother plays nearby with his water gun and toy soldiers Suddenly, and for reasons unclear to his children, the father announces it is time to go and brandishes a gun, firing several shots at them The boy thinks it all to be a game but his sister understands the danger and shields her brother as they run from their mad father She watches in horror as her father returns to the car and sets it on fire before seating himself within and putting a bullet into his head Quickly, and keeping her brother's eyes averted, the girl retrieves their radio, a scarf, and what food she can carry before setting off into the wilderness with her brotherThe siblings walk for hours under the hot sun, calmed by irrelevant radio broadcasts, and walking past a host of wild creatures Come nightfall, they make a crude camp for themselves, much to the boy's delight In the morning, the girl leads them up a rocky hillside where she hopes to find some bearings However, she can see nothing but a broad spanse of wilderness When they finish their lemonade, the girl opens a can of vegetables from which they drink the juice Recalling an uncle's story of military training, the girl suggests they eat salt to retain water and surmises to her brother that they may spend some time in the desert She remains stoic, but wary, while her brother is blissfully unaware of their situation, remaining entertained by the radio and his toys Eventually, after becoming filthy and tired, they come upon a lone tree standing over a pool of water where parakeets flock and feast on fallen fruit The boy puts on in his mouth and proclaims that it 'tastes lovely' They wash in the water and the girl scolds her brother to take care of his clothes so they will last When he asks if they are lost, the girl replies that they are not, trying to remain chipper They sleep to the sounds of the radio as night animals stir around themIn the morning, the girl wakes to find that their water hole has dried up and the fruit has either been eaten or spoiled The girl decides to remain where they are, hoping that the water will return As they nap in the hot sun, the boy spots an aborigine youth David Gulpilil pursuing an animal for food They make contact and the children attempt to communicate with the aborigine boy However, he does not understand their language and merely stares at them with curiosity The girl repeats their need for water but the word is incomprehensible to the aborigine When her brother mimics drinking, the aborigine understands and shows them how to dig for water using a hollow tube to drink through Assuming that he will lead them to civilization, the siblings accompany the aborigine, unaware that he is on a 'walkabout', a coming-of-age journey that every male aborigine youth must take alone in order to be initiated as an adult in his tribeAs they travel the Outback, the aborigine kills and harvests food for them, giving them all plenty to eat and drink The move from the desert to greener pastures and forests where wildlife becomes plentiful When the boy becomes sunburnt from going shirtless, the aborigine rubs pig fat on his back to alleviate the burn While communication between them remains limited, the trio share food and play together, though cultural differences are evident the boy attempts to share his toy soldiers with the aborigine, but he finds no use for them and tosses them aside Despite their time together, the abo"

creature that according to legend resulted from the rape of tree monkeys on Skull Island by plague-carrying rats Stewart, an explorer returning from the depths of the island with his guide and team, is carrying a rat-monkey in a cage and is stopped by fierce warrior natives that demand the return of the monkey Stewart escapes with the cage to the rest of his team and a waiting Jeep, leaving his guide behind and the natives in hot pursuit As the jeep takes off, Stewart's guide catches up and jumps on board In the ensuing melee, Stewart gets bitten by the Rat-Monkey Seeing the mark of the monkey's bite on his right hand, Stewart's men immediately hold down the infected explorer and amputate the appendage A bite mark is then seen on his left arm, which swiftly results in the removal of that limb Finally, they see a set of bloody scratches on Stewart's forehead and kill him The title screen follows the man's dying scream, and as the opening credits roll the captured rat-monkey is shipped to Wellington Zoo in New ZealandWellington, 1957, Lionel Cosgrove lives with his domineering mother, Vera To his mother's dismay, Lionel falls in love with a local shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita, and while snooping on the two during a visit to the zoo, Vera is bitten by the Sumatran Rat-Monkey she subsequently crushes its head The animal's bite slowly turns her into a ravenous zombie Lionel is horrified, but, ever the dedicated son, is determined to care for her Despite his efforts to keep her placated with periodic doses of veterinary anesthetic, Vera starts murdering other townspeople, turning them into zombies He tries to keep them locked away in the basement, while simultaneously trying to maintain his relationship with the completely oblivious Paquita Vera escapes, however, and is hit by a tramAs the townspeople assume she is dead, Lionel tranquilizes the still-kicking zombie for her funeral After she is buried, he returns to the graveyard to administer more anesthetic, but is accosted by a gang of hoodlums Vera bursts from her grave, resulting in more deaths and zombies As their numbers grow, Lionel manages to keep the zombies under relative control with repeated injections, and tries to keep them concealed in his home However, Lionel's uncle Les, arrives to try to wrangle with Lionel over his mother's estate Uncle Les discovers the corpses and blackmails his nephew into giving up his inheritance in return for his silenceLionel reluctantly administers poison to the zombies killing them and buries them, just as Uncle Les and a crowd of his friends arrive for a housewarming party However, the poison turns out to be an animal stimulant, and since the zombies came from the bite of an animal the Rat-Monkey, it only gives them even more energy The zombies burst from the ground to attack and infect the party guests in a gory finaleSome of the guests are running, and some are being eaten by the zombies Lionel goes into a room where he saw Paquita fighting with Uncle Les, and informs them of the zombie outbreak, which horrifies them Uncles Les manages to get out through the window, while Lionel pulls out a large hanger with clothes,

Thursby, who allegedly ran off with her younger sister The two accept the assignment because the money is good, but Spade also implies that the woman looks like trouble, though she projects wholesome innocenceThat night, Detective Tom Polhaus informs Spade that Archer has been shot and killed while tailing Thursby Even later that night, two officers visit Spade at his apartment and inquire about Spade's whereabouts in the last few hours Spade asks what the visit is really about The officers say that Thursby was also killed and that Spade is a suspect, since Thursby likely killed Archer They have no evidence against Spade at the moment, but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matterThe next day, Spade gets a visit from Archer's wife, with whom he has been having an affair The widow asks Spade if he killed Miles so that they could be together Spade dismisses her and tells her to leave, and coldly orders his secretary Effie to remove all of Archer's belongings from the office He then goes to a new address left in a note from his client, whose name he learns is Brigid O'Shaughnessy He also finds out that Brigid never had a sister, and Thursby was her acquaintance who had betrayed herLater, Spade is visited by another man, Joel Cairo, who offers Spade 5000 if the private eye can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived

his person, Spade disarms him and knocks him unconscious After cataloguing Cairo's belongings and questioning him in return, Spade returns Cairo's firearm and allows the man to search his office

not have it at the moment They also refer to a mysterious figure, G the fat man in the film, whom they seem to be scared of The two then continue to talk about some events that happened overseas Eventually, O'Shaughnessy insinuates that Cairo is a homosexual, and Cairo insinuates that O'Shaughnessy simply uses her body to get what she wants, and the two begin to fight At this point, the police show up, coincidentally, to talk to Spade Spade greets them at the door, but refuses to let them in The officers say they know Spade was having an affair with Archer's wife just as they are about to leave, they hear Cairo screaming for help They force their way into Spade's apartment, and Spade invents a story that involves describing how Cairo and O'Shaughnessy were just play-acting The

her scream, and notices that Tina's nightgown is slashed near her stomach The cuts are similar to what would be made with the glove from the dreamTina meets her friends at school the next morning her boyfriend Rod, her best friend Nancy, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Nancy and Tina discover that they have both had the same nightmare, and although Glen and Rod try and hide the fact, they seem to have been having nightmares, too That night, Nancy and Glen decide to stay with Tina, because her mother has gone out of town Rod shows up later and frightens the three of them by making strange sounds in the back yard and then jumping out at Glen Rod and Tina go upstairs into a bedroom to have sex, while Nancy and Glen sleep separately downstairs Nancy resists the idea of fooling around, since she and Glen are supposedly there as moral support for TinaAs all of them fall asleep, strange things begin to occur The wall over Nancy's bed seems to lose its solid form, and the shape of a human figure looking at her seems to lean out of it Nancy does not see it, her eyes closed in half-sleep, and when she awakens, the form disappears In the room where Tina and Rod are sleeping, Tina is awakened by noises at the window someone is in the back yard hurling small rocks at the glass Tina knows this is whoever has been trying to frighten her, and she goes downstairs to confront whoever it is When she ventures out into the back yard, a phantom voice lures her into the alley, the same as in her dream She is startled by strange things such as a goat suddenly lurching into the alley, and then finally her stalker emerges, a man in a fedora, a dirty red and green striped sweater, and the deadly glove with knives for fingers He taunts Tina by laughing at her and whispering her name, and he walks towards her with his arms stretching further than humanly possible, spanning the entire alley, blocking her escape Tina retreats into her back yard and the figure leaps out again, this time from behind a tree He slices off his own fingers and strangely colored blood spurts out Tina tries to make it into her back door, but the man grabs her, and she struggles with him We see Tina in bed next

War II era He describes that many amateurs have tried to get involved in this career, but he implies that they always end up dead Meanwhile, the city is quartered into sectors policed by occupying forces -- the English, the Russians, the Americans and the French -- though they barely can handle the criminal element and don't even speak the same language The city is devastated bombed about a bit, says the narrator, covered in jagged rubble He begins to tell the story of an American coming to Vienna named Holly Martins, who has come to accept a job from an old friendHolly Martins Joseph Cotten gets off his train and is surprised that his friend, Harry Lime, isn't at the station to meet him Holly goes to Lime's flat, but the building porter Paul Hrbiger, through extremely broken English, tells him that he just missed Lime's friends leaving with a coffin The porter says that Harry was killed, hit by a truck right in front of the buildingMartins goes to a massive graveyard and finds a funeral service An Englishman Trevor Howard hovering nearby informs Holly it is Harry's funeral Standing by the grave are two middle-aged men, both of whom eye Holly suspiciously Also in attendance is a pretty woman Alida Valli who doesn't notice him After the funeral, Martins begins to walk back into town, and the Englishman offers him a rideThe stranger introduces himself as Major Calloway, a police officer in the British sector of Vienna, and offers to buy him a drink Holly agrees and proceeds to drink while reminiscing about Harry It is revealed that Holly is an author of pulp Western novellas As he talks about his old friend, Calloway says that it's better that Lime is dead, since he was a murderer and a racketeer Holly takes umbrage at Calloway's suggestion and reaches to punch him, but he's quickly socked in the face by fellow English soldier Sergeant Paine Bernard Lee Paine apologizes and escorts the tipsy Martins to the nearby hotel, explaining to Holly earnestly that he is a huge fan of his books Calloway sets Martins up at the hotel for the night, telling him he can catch a plane out of Vienna the next day Holly promises he will prove him wrong about LimeHappening by on the way out of the hotel is another Englishman named Crabbin Wilfrid Hyde-White Paine tells Crabbin that Holly is an author, and though Crabbin has never heard of him, he is excited to have a writer in Vienna Crabbin introduces himself to Holly and explains he represents the British cultural propaganda department in Vienna He invites Holly to stay and give lecture in a few days at the department's meeting Figuring he could use the extra time in town as an opportunity to look into Harry's death, Holly accepts the offerHolly is then called on the hotel phone by a man who identifies himself as Baron Kurtz The man says he is a friend of Harry's Martins and Kurtz set up a meeting at a nearby cafe When they meet, Holly recognizes Kurtz Ernst Deutsch as one of the two men at Harry's funeral Kurtz is carrying one of Holly's books, which he says Harry had given to him, and a small dogHolly proceeds to grill Kurtz about the circumstances of Harry's death Kurtz and Martins go out to the street in front of Harry's apartment building to reconstruct the events of the accident Kurtz's version is this he was walking out of Harry's flat with him when Harry saw a Romanian friend of his, Popescu, across the street Harry then began to cross the street to greet Popescu when a truck drove up and ran Harry over Then Kurtz and Popescu carried Harry to the sidewalk Shortly thereafter, Harry's doctor, Dr Winkel, happened by The doctor was too late to save Harry, however Holly asks Kurtz to help him investigate further, but Kurtz says as he is an Austrian, he must

while loudly begging forgiveness for having killed Mozart in 1791 Placed in a lunatic asylum for the act, Salieri is visited by a young priest who seeks to take his confession Salieri is sullen and uninterested but eventually warms to the priest and launches into a long confession about his relationship with MozartSalieri's tale goes on through the night and into the next day He reminisces about his youth, particularly about his devotion to God and his love for music and how he pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if he can somehow devote his life to music He describes how his father's plans for him were to go into commerce, but suggests that the sudden death of his father, who choked to death during a meal, was a miracle that allowed him to pursue a career in music In his narrative, he is suddenly an adult joining the 18th century cultural elite in Vienna, the city of musicians Salieri begins his career as a devout, God-fearing man who believes his success and talent as a composer are Gods rewards for his piety He is content as the court composer for Holy Roman Emperor Joseph IIMozart arrives in Vienna with his patron, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg Salieri secretly observes Mozart at the Archbishop's palace, but they are not properly introduced Salieri sees that offstage, Mozart is irreverent and lewd He also first recognizes the immense talent displayed in the adult works of Mozart In 1781, when Mozart meets the Emperor, Salieri presents Mozart with a March of Welcome, which he toiled to create After hearing the march only once, Mozart plays it from memory, critiques it, and effortlessly improvises a variation, transforming Salieri's trifle into the Non pi andrai march from his 1786 opera The Marriage of FigaroSalieri reels at the notion of God speaking through the childish, petulant Mozart nevertheless, he regards his music as miraculous Gradually, Salieris faith is shaken He believes that God, through Mozart's genius, is cruelly laughing at Salieri's own musical mediocrity Salieri's struggles with God are intercut with scenes showing Mozart's own trials and tribulations with life in Vienna pride at the initial reception of his music anger and disbelief over his subsequent treatment by the Italians of the Emperor's court happiness with his wife Constanze and his son Karl and grief at the death of his father Leopold Mozart becomes more desperate as the family's expenses increase and his commissions decrease When Salieri learns of Mozart's financial straits, he sees his chance to avenge himself, using God's Beloved the literal meaning of Amadeus as the instrumentSalieri hatches a complex plot to gain ultimate victory over Mozart and God He disguises himself in a mask and costume similar to one he saw Leopold wear at a party, and commissions Mozart to write a requiem mass, giving him a down payment and the promise of an enormous sum upon completion Mozart begins to write the piece, the Requiem Mass in D minor, unaware of the true identity of his mysterious patron and oblivious of his murderous intentions Glossing over any details of how he might commit the murder, Salieri dwells on the anticipation of the admiration of his peers and the court, when they applaud the magnificent Requiem, and he claims to be the music's composer Only Salieri and God would know the truththat Mozart wrote his own requiem mass, and that God could only watch while Salieri finally receives the fame and renown he deservesMozart's financial situation worsens and the composing demands

troops on the eve of battle His uniform is impeccable, his medals uncountable, and his ramrod demeanor unassailable As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human conditionNorth Africa, 1942 In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten In the post-battle assessment, Gen Omar Bradley Karl Malden decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the fieldIn Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character They note he is a romantic, reads the Bible daily, swears like a stableboy, and believes in reincarnation Rommel, when asked what he intends to do about Patton, simply replies I will attack and annihilate himbefore he does the same to meSoon the Germans move against the American positions in Tunisia, and Patton watches in fascination from his command post in the hills nearby Anticipating Rommel's plan, he routs the Germans, and gives the Americans their first victory, further inflating his ego North Africa now has two prima donnas Patton, and the equally egotistical British commander, Field Marshal Montgomery Michael Bates Naturally, they come to dislike each other intensely, and as the African campaign draws to a close, plans are made for the invasion of Italy Patton wines and dines the appropriate officals, and pitches his own plan to invade through Sicily Montgomery has other plans, and when Monty's are adopted over his own, Patton, outraged, vows to outdo the Field Marshal at all costsSicily is invaded, and Montgomery's troops fight their way up the East coast against heavy German resistance Patton is assigned the support role of guarding Montomery's flank, but soon adopts another plan and begins to push across the island, taking the long way around First taking Palermo, then pushing East to Messina, he races Montgomery to the finish line, pushing his men to the breaking point and creating dissension among his commanders They do not wish to sacrifice more American casualties to Patton's egoSoon, Montgomery and the British forces march into the liberated city of Messina amid the cheering populace Flags wave and the pipers play as they march triumphantly into the town square Monty has done it He's driven the Germans out of Sicily and beaten Patton to the punch Abruptly, the pipers falter, and fall silent Monty quickly marches to the fore to investigate, and finds Patton, his tanks and troops neatly arrayed behind him, standing there silently with an insufferable smile on his lips He'd arrived hours ago, and was waiting only to greet his old rivalAs the Italian campaign continues, Patton becomes more controversial During a routine inspection of wounded men in a field hospital, he encounters a shell-shocked soldier crying in a corner and becomes enraged with what he perceives as a display of cowardice Slapping the soldier, he rages at him and orders him sent back to the front This outburst gets Patton

Huge shock waves radiate out from the blast site On board the USS Excelsior, Captain Hikaru Sulu George Takei makes an official entry in his log, noting that his mission of cataloging gaseous anomalies in Beta Quadrant is over and they are returning to Earth The ship is suddenly struck by one of the shock waves from the explosion Sulu orders his crew to restore control to the ship, which is done quickly Looking over their scanning equipment, the crew determines that the shock wave originated at the location of the Klingon moon Praxis Sulu remarks that Praxis is the primary source of energy for the Klingon Empire, and orders a message be sent stating he and his crew will assist if necessary They receive an emergency transmission from Praxis showing a Klingon worker consumed in flames A second message comes from Brigadier General Kerla Paul Rossilli that acknowledges the explosion he calls it an incident and that they do not require assistance from the Federation He also commands them to stay out of the Neutral Zone When one of the crew asks if they should report the incident, Sulu replies Are you kiddingOn Earth two months later, Captain James Kirk William Shatner, Dr Leonard McCoy DeForest Kelley and Engineer Montgomery Scott James Doohan attend a top-level meeting of Starfleet They are told that the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life remaining Charge of the meeting is turned over to the Federation's special envoy, Captain Spock Leonard Nimoy He tells the committee that the explosion of Praxis two months earlier has caused an environmental catastrophe on the Klingon homeworld of Q'ono'S Kronos Pollution of the planet's ozone layer has left Klingon civilization with only 50 Earth years of oxygen The Klingon Empire, due to its enormous military budget, is unable to reverse the devastation and has turned to the Federation for assistance However, as Spock notes, assistance cannot begin until a treaty has been negotiated with the Federation of Planets to cease all hostilities between the two Spock, being the Federation's envoy, had been speaking directly with Chancellor Gorkon David Warner of the Klingon Empire to open treaty proposalsThe committee is stunned by the news and debates whether Starfleet will be dissolved Science and exploration will continue, however, military efforts will see a significant reduction Admiral Cartwright protests, saying that the opportunity exists to bring them to their knees Spock counters, saying that a peaceful solution is more prudent In the midst of the debate, it is announced that Kirk will be sent in the Enterprise to the outskirts of Klingon space to escort Chancellor Gorkon's cruiser to Earth for negotiations Kirk is wholly reluctant, despite Spock's endorsement of him, saying an experienced ambassador should be sent, however, the council leadership ignores him and closes the meetingAfter everyone has left the meeting, Kirk confronts Spock, demanding to know why Spock chose him to escort the Chancellor Kirk has a high distrust of Klingons, who were responsible for the murder of his son, David Marcus Spock believes that Kirk, though an unlikely candidate for the mission, should still go, saying Only Nixon could go to China Kirk also mentions that the Enterprise's crew was due to stand down retire in a few monthsKirk gathers his crew and the Enterprise leaves Earth New to the Enterprise is Lt Valeris Kim Cattrall, a Vulcan female officer, who is the first of her race to graduate at the top of her class, having been mentored and sponsored by Spock himself As the ship races towards the rendezvous point with Gorkon, she and Spock share a ceremonial drink in his quarters and discuss the turning point of Federation relations with the Klingon Empire

Caribbean Sea, encounters an unidentified submerged object moving at high speed The object passes very close to the submarine and the vessel loses power Power is restored after a few moments, however the sub has drifted too close to the underwater canyon wall and collides with it, causing catastrophic damage An officer is able to launch the sub's emergency beacon before the sub floods, drowning the entire crewAs Soviet ships and submarines head toward the area in an attempt to salvage the sub and its, and with a hurricane moving in, the Americans decide that the quickest way to mount a rescue is for a US Navy SEAL team to be inserted onto a privately owned experimental underwater oil drilling platform, which they will then use as their base of operations The platform's designer and chief engineer, Dr Lindsey Brigman Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, is furious at the notion of her rig being commandeered for the mission Her estranged husband, Virgil Bud Brigman Ed Harris is the foreman of the platform However, Benthic Petroleum, the rig's financier, has already agreed to cooperate with the Navy and has promised the rig's crew substantial bonus pay Lindsey herself travels down to the rig with the SEAL team to oversee the operation personally After eight hours in a compression chamber, Lindsey and the SEAL team emerge no one, however, sees that SEAL leader Lt Hiram Coffey Michael Biehn has developed High Pressure Nervous Syndrome HPNS when he has a slight hand tremor Lindsey and Bud promptly begin arguing with each other, revealing that they are a separated married couple Bud becomes furious and throws his wedding band into a chemical toilet He relents after a few moments and fishes it out, staining his hand blue with the toilet's sanitation fluidThe rig and SEAL teams prepare to investigate the submarine wreck One of the SEALs shows crew members Hippy Todd Graff and Catfish Leo Burmester a high-tech underwater breathing system that uses oxygenated

angrily reprimanding the crew when they begin joking with each otherWhile searching the sub for survivors, the collective team encounters strange creatures they can't identify, the same beings that inadvertently caused the submarine to sink Lindsey, piloting one of the rig's three mini-subs, experiences the same type of power loss that the Montana did While searching a compartment on the Montana, Bud's partner, Jammer John Bedford Lloyd, the rig crew's biggest member, sees a strange, glowing creature and panics When he tries to escape the chamber, he damages a valve on his breathing apparatus and begins to convulse Bud and his comrades are able to save Jammer, but the incident puts him in a comaAs the storm intensifies, Coffey and his team communicate with their commanding officer on the surface, who tells them that a Russian attack sub was detected in the area The team is ordered to retrieve a Trident missile warhead and arm it as a contingency if the Russians get too close to the MontanaCoffey and the SEALs take one of the rig's mini-subs without authorization Using the sub's large mechanized arm, they are able to open a launch door of the Montana and extract one of the Tridents However, the mini-sub they commandeered was the only vehicle capable of disconnecting the station's umbilical cord to its parent surface ship, the Benthic Explorer Upon their return,

including Grocer Dan Aykroyd, whose efforts to cartelize the business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the solitary Martin Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his understandably nervous therapist Alan Arkin and his secretary Joan Cusack, already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contractUpon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry Minnie Driver, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store Reconnecting with friends like Paul Jeremy Piven is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets Meanwhile Martin is being stalked by rival hitmen, including Grocer and Felix LaPoubelle Benny Urquidez, a Basque terrorist hired to kill him as well as two awkward National Security Agency agents Hank Azaria and K Todd Freeman, briefed by Grocer, waiting for him to do his job so they can kill him Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends and procrastinates, not even bothering to glance at the background dossier on the prospective targetAt the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her adorable toddler Martin stares into the child's face and experiences an existential transformation, recognizing that his recent dissatisfaction with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life Moments later, reflecting on his decision while exploring the halls of his old high school, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking after all, flees the reunion Paul follows only moments later to find Martin, who corrals him into helping to dispose of LaPoubelle's body in the school furnace Later Debi confronts Martin in his hotel room, where he reveals that psychological testing in the Army revealed a certain moral flexibility that made him suitable for a CIA-sponsored mechanical operations program After leaving the CIA, he went into business for himself His rationalizations for his work only horrify Debi even more she rejects his attempts at reconciliation, and storms out Martin, concluding that it is futile to attempt to change his life, fires his psychiatrist over the phone and finally opens the dossier containing the details of the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe and is startled to find that the target is Bart Newberry Mitchell Ryan, Debi's father, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's clientGrocer decides to stop waiting for Martin to kill Bart and attempts the job himself, to impress Martin's client and boost his own business Out of loyalty to Debi, and his newfound care for life, Martin abandons the contract and rescues Bart from certain death, speeding him to the Newberry house and holing up inside, narrowly ahead of Grocer and his team of mercenaries During the siege, Martin finally reveals that he stood Debi up on prom night to enlist in the Army to channel his strong homicidal urges away from his family and friends Martin gradually kills the team of

laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin musicLittle is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horsea sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grassis heard From the fog emerge two pedestrians King Arthur Graham Chapman, dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown and Patsy Terry Gilliam, who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussivelyThey approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia England, as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding offThe scene changes to a plague village A cart is being drawn through the streets, and is attended by a disheveled man Eric Idle who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to bring out your dead A peasant John Cleese tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart, without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive The attendant refuses to accept living cargo citing regulations When the peasant tries to abstractly request a favour, the attendant looks up and down the street to make sure there are no witnesses, and strikes the elderly subject a deadly blow to the head, solving the problem The cart and the peasant continue on their ways Arthur and Patsy emulate a ride through the village, and the attendant correctly infers that Arthur is a king from the fact that he is not covered in shitOn a hillside, near a castle, Arthur approaches a peasant Michael Palin from behind and calls out Old woman The peasant, Dennis, barely turns his head to correct the king with man Rather than killing this vulgar subject on the spot for such gross insubordination, Arthur tries to apologize for the mistake Unimpressed, Dennis then launches into a rant, making it very clear that he has harboured a great deal of bitterness over the class system, which he has experienced from the bottom all his life of 37 years Arthur is challenged to justify his kingship, and to an accompaniment of heavenly voices, tells the tale of the Lady of the Lake presenting Arthur with Excalibur Dennis confidently challenges this presumption of political legitimacy Focusing on the executive branch, he asserts that it must derive from a mandate from the masses Arthur can only respond by barking orders that the peasant be silent Unaffected, Dennis continues his elocution of democratic dogma, at which point Arthur manhandles him This only encourages Dennis he becomes a raving firebrand, and tries to call as much attention as possible to Arthur's assault The king accepts that he cannot adequately assert this authority in this situation, and relinquishes Dennis with Bloody peasant Dennis, despite his anger, appears delighted at this parting shot, and its significance to his message He seeks validation from the gathering crowdWhile travelling through a forest, Arthur and Patsy encounter an epic battle between two armoured, faceless men The weapons swords, an anointed mace, and an axe When the black-clad

periods the early 1920s, the early 1930s and the year 1968 The story is also jumps back and forth between these times and is summarized chronologically hereIn 1968, David Noodles Aaronson Robert De Niro, returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY following a prolonged absence He has been called back to his old neighborhood under mysterious circumstances he's received a notice from a local rabbi telling him that the cemetery in his old neighborhood is being closed and the remains of those buried there are being moved He sets himself up in with a room in a bar owned by an old friend, Fat Moe Larry Rapp, and begins to investigate the summons he received Noodles is suspicious of the letter, thinking he's been called back to see to the reburial of his old friends, Patrick Patsy Goldberg James Hayden, Philip Cockeye Stein William Forsythe, and Max Bercovic James Woods, who he used to be in a gang with Noodles believes someone is seeking revenge against himIn the earliest time period, the early 1920s, the boys grow up in poverty in a Jewish neighborhood of the Lower East Side They ostensibly work for a young local gangster named Bugsy, however, Noodles and his friends Patsy, Cockeye and Dominic, have ambitions to strike out on their own One day, while attempting to roll a drunk, they are foiled in their plot by Max, who is just moving into the neighborhood with his mother He keeps the drunk's pocket watch and leaves the boys to be harassed by a policeman, Whitey whom the boys call Fartface who constantly bullies them Noodles finds Max later and demands the watch back Whitey happens by and takes the watch for himself Noodles and Max come to admire each others resolve and decide to be friends Though Noodles and Max seem to share the leadership of the gang, it is Max who is the more charismatic and makes most of the decisions for themOne day Patsy spies Whitey walking along the rooftops of the neighborhood and follows him Patsy immediately realizes that Whitey is going to see their pre-teen and physically matured friend, Peggy, who prostitutes herself The boys catch Whitey in the act and photograph him Patsy quickly disappears with the film plate Whitey acquiesces to their demands that, as the new gang in the area, he pay them as much in tribute as he does Bugsy and that he do some enforcement work for them They also get their watch back from him and make him pay for Noodles and Max to have sex with PeggyNoodles has long desired to be romantically involved with a girl, Deborah Jennifer Connelly, who lives in his building and whose father owns the local kosher restaurant in the neighborhood While using the men's room in the restaurant, David often spies on Deborah through a small hole in the wall while she practices her ballet steps Deborah, however, mostly ignores his advances, with the exception of an intimate moment they share when the restaurant's closed during PassoverThe boys become something of a success in their neighborhood, thieving houses and stores and rolling more drunks and other weaker types for small earnings that are substantial for themselves When Bugsy hears that there's another gang that isn't under his control, he and his thugs horribly beat Noodles and Max Undaunted, the boys meet with a local Italian mobster, Capuano, and show him an invention of Noodles' that will allow Capuano to keep all the imported cargo he illegally deals even after his ships crews are forced to throw it overboard by harbor customs agents The invention is a success and the boys become very wealthy, receiving 10 of Capuano's earnings They rent a train station locker and stash their cash earnings in a leather briefcase, promising that they will only withdraw or deposit funds from the locker when they are all present and that the key will be kept by Fat Moe On their way back from the station, they're attacked by Bugsy, who this time carries a pistol Dominic is the only member of the gang who is"

having a celebration led by Kathy Williams Janet Leigh However, the centennial is also marked by ominous events, including the appearance of a glowing fog that spreads over land and seaIn the first scene, on the night before the town's celebration, a group of children seated around a campfire on a beach, are entertained by a ghost story, told by 'old' Mr Machen John Houseman exactly at the stroke of midnight, the resident elderly fisherman The story being told is indicative of the history of the town's formation, which is being discovered at that exact moment by the local priest, Father Malone Hal Holbrook, when he finds the diary of his grandfather who was also the town's priestThe diary later reveals a dark secret unknown to the current inhabitants where, in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay including Malone's grandfather deliberately sank and plundered the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay The six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the clipper, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them Everyone aboard the ship perished The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the shipThe mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper's crew, who have come back on the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to apparently take the lives of six people symbolic substitutes for the six conspiratorsThis same night, three local fishermen, Al Williams, Tommy Wallace, and Dick Baxter, are gruesomely murdered by supernatural attackers after the fog covers their boat Just prior to their deaths, Al and Tommy are standing on the deck of the boat and can see a ghostly looking ship pulling along side theirs, through the dense, but glowing fogAt the same time, Nick Castle Tom Atkins drives down a country road and picks up a hitchhiker called Elizabeth Jamie Lee Curtis who claims to be on her way to Vancouver While the two drive towards town, the radio and headlights of the car start to fail, as the windows of the truck are blown out At the same time, various odd phenomena begin to happen around the sleeping town chairs move, television sets turn themselves on, gas stations seemingly come to lifeA short time later, Nick and Elizabeth have arrived at Nick's coastal home and are relaxing when a heavy knock is heard at the door Making his way to open the glass, front door, Nick sees an odd light shining outside, illuminating a shadowy figure The clock strikes 1AM, and it's face suddenly cracks, just as Nick opens the door, only to see there is no one there, and the fog has dissipatedThe following morning, while in her bungalow next to the beach, the local radio DJ Stevie Wayne Adrianne Barbeau is lying in bed when her young son, Andy, returns to the house showing her a broken plank of wood he has discovered It reads DANE Intrigued by the piece, Stevie keeps it and takes it with her to the lighthouse, where she is preparing for her next show and listening to various promotional tapes for her station Stevie sets the plank on top of the tape player that is playing the promotional spots, and while she is momentarily distracted, the plank begins to seep water The water spreads and causes the tape player to short Suddenly, Blake's voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, the words 6 Must Die appear on the plank, and the plank bursts into flames A shocked Stevie immediately extinguishes the fire Afterwards, Stevie checks the plank only to find that it once again reads DANEMeanwhile, Nick and Elizabeth charter a

contents shrink her to a tiny fraction of her original size The door is locked, and the key appears on the table, which she can not reach The Doorknob directs her to a cookie marked Eat me The cookie

Pink confesses to having hidden the diamonds in a secure location However, they violently argue about whether or not to take the unconscious Mr Orange to a hospital when Mr White reveals that he had told the former his true first name, Larry Mr Blonde, who has been watching them from the shadows, steps forward and ends the dispute White angrily chews out Blonde for his antics, while Blonde calmly defends himself, saying simply that he'd warned the staff of the jeweler's not to touch the alarm He tells them not to leave the rendezvous as Nice Guy Eddie is on his way Mr Blonde walks to his car

film opens, Lucas Jackson Paul Newman is using a pipe cutter to cut the tops off of parking meters He is drinking, possibly drunk, but not violent When the police arrive, he is peacefully arrested Off-screen apparently he is tried, convicted of destroying public property, and sentenced to two years in prisonLuke and three other men have been sentenced to a rural Florida road gang performing hard labor When he arrives at the prison, the warden reads through his record He remarks that Luke had been in the Army, attained the rank of Sargeant, won numerous war medals, but was discharged as a private Something he did got him busted back down to the same rank at which he entered the ArmyDragline George Kennedy is clearly the leader of the prisoners He is uneducated and illiterate, but smarter, stronger, bigger, and does not hesitate to exercise his power over them Most of the prisoners willingly submit to Dragline, but Luke does not There is no open opposition to Dragline, just a casual refusal to change his behavior in order to please others Nevertheless, Dragline sees this as a threat to his power and dominanceThe men leave at sunset and perform over 12 hours daily of grueling hard labor under intense heat and humidity on the side of the road cutting grass with a sickle or shoveling dirt One of the new prisoners passes out the first day and another one tries to get out of the detail by sweeping, which was a trick played on him Luke makes it the first day, but exhausted and barely able to get back into the truckAt the end of the first day for the new men, Alibi, the one that tried to get out of the hard labor by sweeping, is made to sleep in the box the first night, a cramped isolation unit outside to learn a lesson to not challenge the guardsAfter Luke says something that Dragline takes as a challenge to his authority, Dragline arranges for he and Luke to have a boxing match Being much larger, Dragline simply pounds Luke into a pulp, but Luke will not give up, or stay down on the ground What begins as a boxing match with enthusiastic prisoners and guards watching slowly turns into a sad spectacle Prisoners begin to plead with Luke to lay down and refuse to get back up, and eventually Dragline himself pleads with Luke to simply stop fighting back, but Luke will not stop The prisoners begin to walk away, unable to watch the sad scene any longer Dragline himself wants the fight to end, and at one point has to catch the beaten and exhausted Luke from falling down, carrying him across his shoulder and gently setting him on the ground, only to have Luke use what little strength he has left to tap Dragline with one last punch Finally, even Dragline cannot continue The only men who are still watching are the guards and the warden, but the warden seems concerned at Luke's stubbornness and the guards remain indifferentLuke becomes the prisoners' hero, and even Dragline is now respectful of Luke during a card game that night of having tricked a fellow opponent on betting with a bad hand dealt, giving him the name Cool Hand LukeOn the chain gang, Luke encourages the other prisoners, by his own attitude and energy, to excel at their menial tasks This not only encourages camaraderie among the prisoners, it deprives the guards of a stick to hold over the prisoners' heads The prisoners are forced to shovel sand over a freshly tarred road, and they perform the job so quickly and with such a sense of competition that they complete the job early, and thus by default earn a few hours of relaxation, because there is no more road on which to workOn a Sunday, Luke's mother comes to visit him, visibly ill and dying of cancer or emphysema and still chain-smoking, and it is clear that Luke gets his independent streak from her He

modesty by Francie, and claws-baring jealousy from DanielleFrancie is not afraid of a little fun Although she sees through Robie's cover as an American industrialist, the considerable charms of this thief are worth catching She dangles before him her jewels, teases him with steamy tales of rooftop escapades, exposes herself as a feline of a special breed an accomplice who might share his passion Fireworks fill the night and can even be seen in the skyThat night, Jessie's jewels are stolen, and Francie suddenly feels that Robie has taken advantage of her He narrowly evades the clutches of the police and goes back on the lamHe stakes out a house where he believes the new burglar will strike and is violently attacked In the ensuing struggle he kills the attacker It's Foussard, Bertani's wine stewardThe police chief is satisfied that Foussard was the jewel thief, but, as Robie points out to him in the presence of the abashed Hughson, this would have been impossible Foussard had a prosthetic leg and couldn't possibly climb on rooftopsAfter Robie is ejected from Foussard's funeral, Francie apologizes and confesses her love for him They agree to attend a masquerade ball the coming weekendAt the ball, Francie is resplendent in a gold gown in the style worn at the court of Louis XV, Robie unrecognizable behind the mask of her attendant, a Moor The police hover nearby, hoping to arrest Robie When Jessie asks the Moor to go get her heart pills, Robie's voice tips off the authorities to his identity After he returns, Francie and the Moor dance the night away while the police wait them out But upstairs the cat burglar strikes, cleaning out many a jewelry box Finally, Francie and the Moor go to her room, and the mask is removed the Moor is Hughson, switched in to conceal Robie's exitMeanwhile, Robie waits and watches on the roof His patience is rewarded when another figure in black appears But just as his pursuit begins, the police throw a spotlight on him Again he flees and shots ring out, but he manages to corner his foe with jewels in hand Unmasked, his nemesis turns out not to be a man after all Danielle is the new Cat, and she confesses that she's been working for her father and Bertani to frame Robie for the latest thefts Danielle tries to get away but slips and nearly falls, until Robie has a change of h"

They're coming to get you, Barbra They are approached by a pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and attacks Barbra Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by somethingIn a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron

incapacitated on a couch in the living room listening to the radio report Emergency broadcasters tell stories of widespread violence and mayhem being committed by people who seem to be in a 'trance'

of a crime where Shelly Webster Sofia Shinas has been beaten and raped and her fianc, local musician and guitarist Eric Draven Brandon Lee, has been murdered, having been stabbed, shot, and thrown out of their apartment window to the streets below The couple had been planning their wedding for the next day Halloween A cop comments darkly, Who gets married on Halloween Albrecht responds, NobodyAs he prepares to leave for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl with a skateboard named Sarah Rochelle Davis who says she is a friend of Eric and Shelly and that they took care of her Albrecht tells her that Shelly probably won't surviveOne year later, a crow flies over the dark and rainy landscape of Detroit and lands on the headstone of Eric Draven It taps at the stone with its beak, awakening Eric from the grave He climbs out of the ground, trembling and wracked with convulsions With some confusion, he stands and walks with the crow to his abandoned apartment, finding it in shambles Memories of the night of his death come back to him as the gang responsible runs through the city, setting fire to it The faces of the attackers stick in his mind and, bent on vengeance, he changes his clothes and paints his face white in parody of a porcelain harlequin mask he had given Shelly as a gift He then draws black liner around his eyes and down his cheeks like tears and paints his lips black with glasgow lines reaching out from the corners Guided by the crow and sharing the crow's high perspective on the city, Eric sets out to avenge his murder and Shelly's deathThe first person he locates is Tin Tin Laurence Mason, a thug obsessed with knives Eric engages in one on one combat, discovering in the process that he is immune to harm He wins the fight by catching a knife and pinning Tin Tin to the wall with it Eric confronts him about the murders the previous year and Tin Tin laughs in his face, mocking Shelly Eric finishes him off by stabbing him in each vital organ in alphabetical order with his own knives and takes his trench coat, leaving a crow-shaped bloodstain on the wall of the alley Using Tin Tin's memories, he goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin sold Shelly's engagement ring Eric forces the owner, Gideon Jon Polito, to show him where the ring is located and finds it mixed in a box with dozens of other rings He lets Gideon live so that he can deliver a message of death to the rest of the gang before he breaks a gas pipe, loads a shotgun with other rings of destroyed lives, and ignites the shop in a massive explosionEric locates the next thug on his list, Funboy Michael Massee, getting high in an apartment with Sarah's drug-addicted mother, Darla Anna Levine Funboy shoots Eric in his hand and Eric mocks him by pretending to scream in pain before showing the hole in his palm heal before his eyes Frightened, Funboy is easily disarmed by Eric and is shot in the thigh before being injected with an overdose of morphine Eric then confronts Darla but merely says that morphine is bad for her, taking the drug out of her arm seemingly by magic, and tells her that she should return to her daughter who is waiting for her on the streetsAlbrecht, meanwhile, has been following the deaths of the thugs around town He doesn't share the rest of the department's view on the killings, thinking of them as more of a blessing than a

inside a tree house with his best friends Chris Chambers River Phoenix and Teddy Duchamp Corey Feldman Each boy has his own story and a reputation to follow Chris comes from a family renowned for their dishonesty and abusive nature, which gives him a bad rap despite his tough but kind disposition Teddy, rather eccentric, is recognizable by the mangled remains of his right ear which his mentally unstable father held down to a hot stove top His father resides in a mental institution but Teddy speaks highly of him for serving in WWII The fourth of their group and the butt of many jokes, portly Vern Tessio Jerry O'Connell, begs to be let in the tree house, saying he has important news The others make light fun of him until he asks if they want to go see a dead body They all fall silent as he explains that, while looking for a misplaced penny jar under his porch, he overheard his older brother Billy Casey Siemaszko and friend Charlie Hogan Gary Riley discuss how Billy found the body of Ray Brower, a kid who had recently gone missing Gordie and his friends followed the story closely because Ray was around their age, last seen picking blueberries in the woods outside of town Billy says the kid must have been hit by a train and refuses to report the discovery to the police because he was at the site in a stolen carGordie and the others decide to go find the body and accept recognition as local heroes They make plans to tell their parents they're sleeping over at each other's homes the next day and to meet the next morning on the train tracks leading out of town Come morning, Gordie goes to fetch his canteen in his older brother's room A few months prior his brother, Denny John Cusack, a popular athlete, died in a car accident Gordie's mother Frances Lee McCain has been silent and distant since then and his father Marshall Bell asks him why he can't have friends like Denny's or play sports like him He has no interest in his son's aspirations to become a writer and criticizes Chris for stealing milk money at school The only support Gordie received was from his brother who gave him an old Yankee cap, something he now cherishesGordie meets Chris in town who takes him to a back alley and shows him the gun he swiped from his father's bureau Gordie lightly takes aim at a garbage can and pulls the trigger, thinking it's not loaded It is It fires and sends the two running for the main street where they come across a few members of a gang led by Ace Merrill Kiefer Sutherland Chris's older brother, Eyeball Bradley Gregg leers at the boys as Ace steals Gordie's cap and threatens Chris with a lit cigarette They let the boys go unharmed and walk away, laughing Gordie and Chris meet up with Teddy and Vern at the train tracks where they realize no one's brought food They take out their money and agree to buy something along the way As a train approaches, everyone but Teddy gets off the tracks Teddy imitates shooting an automatic at the train, intent on dodging it at the last second, 'just like my father in Normandy' Chris, however, pulls him off before the stunt can be performed and yells at him for nearly killing himselfThey soon arrive at a local junkyard that is rumored to house a disgruntled owner with a ferocious dog named Chopper which he's supposedly trained to attack any intruders, going right for the person's balls However, the yard is empty and the four rest in the shade of a car hood for a few minutes while Gordie, after losing a race, goes to retrieve food at the store on the other side On his way back, he

Wallace tells about the sudden appearance nearby of a miracle of miracle The ZoneThe next scene shows a dingy room where three figures, a man, a woman, and a child, are asleep together in a wrought iron bed Next to the bed is a pair of crutches The man slowly gets up, dresses, goes to the kitchen sink and washes himself The woman, his wife Alisa Frejndlikh, joins him and scolds him for returning

derelict, who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance Peachy Carnehan Michael Caine Peachy tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot Sean Connery travelled to remote Kafiristan a provence in modern-day Afghanistan, became gods, and ultimately lost everythingFive years earlier The pair of rogues had met Kipling at his office After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing drink and women until they achieved their grandiose aims, Peachy and Danny set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass, travelling by night and avoiding hostile Afghan villages, fighting off bandits, blizzards and avalanches, into the unknown land of Kafiristan literally in the Afghan Dari languages means Land of the Non-Muslim InfidelsA few days later, Peachy and Danny happen upon a former Gurkha soldier who goes by the name Billy Fish Saeed Jaffrey, the sole survivor of a mapping expedition several years before Billy speaks English as well as the local tongue, and it is he, acting as translator and interpreter of the customs and manners, who smooths the path of Peachy and Danny as they begin their rise, first offering their services as military advisors, trainers, and war leaders to the chief of a much-raided villagePeachy and Danny muster a force to attack the villagers' most-hated enemy In their first battle, the natives decide that Danny must be a god when he is unharmed after being struck in the chest by an arrow In fact, the arrow was stopped by a bandolier hidden beneath his clothing As victory follows victory, the defeated warriors are recruited to join the swelling armyFinally, there is no one left to stand in their way, and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul There, the head holy man sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, in order to determine whether Danny is a man or a god by seeing if he bleeds or not When Danny flinches, the monks grab him and rip open his shirt, only to be stopped however, by Danny's Masonic Jewel given to him for luck by fellow Mason Kipling By coincidence, the symbol on the Jewel matches that of Sikander Alexander the Great, who had passed through many centuries ago and promised to return The holy men are convinced Danny is the reincarnation of Sikander They hail him as king and lead the two men down to storerooms heaped with treasure gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, rubys, emerals, etc that belonged to Sikander, which now belong to DannyAs the months pass, Peachy is anxious to leave Kafiristan with all the treasure they can carry before winter closes the mountain passes to India and before the natives learn the truth However, Danny is against it however and develops delusions of grandeur as the power of god-king goes to his head which will lead to the duo's downfall First Danny suggests that Peachy bow to him like the others Then he begins making plans to turn the land into a modern country, to the extent that he envisages eventually meeting Queen Victoria as an equal Disgusted, Peachy decides to take as much booty as he can carry on a small mule train, with his old friend's blessingMeanwhile, Danny decides to take a wife after seeing the beautiful Roxanne Shakira, despite Peachy's strong warnings Roxanne, having a superstitious fear that she will be struck dead if she consorts with a god, tries frantically to escape, biting Danny during the wedding ceremony The bite draws blood, and when everyone sees it, they realise Danny is human after allThe angry natives pursue him and Peachy as they attempt to escape from the city Billy tries to buy time by courageously charging the mob singlehandedly with a Khukuri, but the pair are soon captured Danny is forced to walk to the middle of a rope bridge over

engineered Replicants, which are essentially humans who are designed for labor and entertainment purposes They are illegal on earth, and if they make it to our planet they are hunted down and killedRick Deckard is a blade runner, a hunter of replicants A group of replicants makes it to Los Angeles seeking a way to extend their life span Replicants have a built-in 4 year life span, and this group is near the endA crawl after the opening credits informs us that, in the near future, technology that has created synthetic humans has entered a new phase replicants, sophisticated androids that are virtually identical to humans, are now equal in strength and emotion to their creators Replicants are designed and built by the Tyrell Corporation, a giant multi-conglomerate headquartered in two pyramid-like towers The latest version of replicant technology is the Nexus 6 model Replicants are mostly used as manual laborers in the off world colonies out in space Because of their advanced nature and tendency towards violence, replicants have been outlawed on Earth Specialized police units, blade runners, are charged with the difficult task of detecting replicants who come to Earth If found, replicants are executed or retired An opening title tells us that the setting for the story is Los Angeles, and the date is November, 2019 Los Angeles and the surrounding area have become heavily industrialized, crowded with people and rain falls constantlyAt the Tyrell Corporation, a blade runner, Holden Morgan Paull is interviewing a new employee using a special device called a Voight-Kampff VK analyzer The machine is designed to detect any physical changes in the test subject in response to questions that are deliberately meant to affect the subject emotionally After a few questions, the man being tested, Leon, becomes obviously agitated and eventually hostile, shooting Holden We learn later that Holden survived He can breathe okay, as long as nobody unplugs himDeckard Harrison Ford, a former blade runner, is eating at a Japanese noodle bar when another man, Gaff Edward James Olmos, tells him he's under arrest Deckard tries to ignore the man but eventually agrees to

illegally Two of them were killed trying to scale a high-voltage security fence outside the Tyrell Corporation Four have survived Bryant shows Deckard their files The leader is Roy Batty Rutger Hauer, the most advanced and intelligent of the group The others are Z hora Joanna Cassidy, Pris Darryl Hannah and Leon Brion James, the replicant who shot Holden Deckard is charged with tracking them down Bryant also tells Deckard that the Nexus-6s are believed to be advanced enough that they may have developed emotions, which might make them harder to detect via VK testing Subsequently, the scientists designed the Nexus-6s to have only a four year lifespan Bryant sends Deckard to Tyrell Corp's headquarters to test the VK machine on a Nexus-6Deckard and Gaff fly to Tyrell headquarters While Deckard awaits Tyrell, he meets Rachael Sean Young, a beautiful woman who welcomes him and who acts as Tyrell's personal assistant Tyrell Joe Turkel appears and questions Deckard about the Voight-Kampff test, doubting its processes in detecting replicants among humans Tyrell offers Rachael as a test subject, saying he wants to see a negative test result on a human before providing a replicant to be tested Deckard asks Rachael over 100 test questions before the VK machine finally alerts Deckard that Rachael is actually a replicant Rachael leaves and Tyrell explains that Rachael is a Nexus-6 and one of

home alone all day, young Matilda makes frequent trips to the library for mental stimulation She develops a love for reading, and for knowledge in generalMatilda's intelligence does not impress her father, who interprets it as being a smart-aleck After being unfairly punished once too often, Matilda plays a stealthy string of practical jokes on Harry including swapping his hair oil with bleaching peroxide, and gluing his hat to his head After a particularly nasty outburst from Harry, Matilda stares at the television in anger until it explodes Confused by the phenomenon, she shakes it offA disgruntled Harry finally enrolls Matilda in Crunchum Hall Elementary, after the principal becomes a customer at his dealership Miss Agatha Trunchbull Pam Ferris, the headmistress, is an enormous, intimidating, and brutal woman with a passionate hatred for children Matilda arrives at her first day of kindergarten and befriends two students, Hortensia and Lavender, who warn her of Miss Trunchbull's violent habits The student body witnesses Trunchbull, an ex-Olympian, perform a human hammerthrow, and fling a little girl over a nearby fence by her pigtails Despite the initial horrors of Crunchum Hall, Matilda's teacher Miss Honey Embeth Davitz is a kind and gentle woman, and Matilda is praised for her intelligence for the first timeMiss Honey speaks with Matilda's parents at their house and attempts to convince them of their daughter's brilliance They rebuff her rudely, but she is not dissuaded from finding intellectual stimulation for Matilda The next day at school, Miss Trunchbull once again demonstrates her cruelty Calling all the students to a special assembly, she devises a public punishment for a boy called Bruce Bogtrotter who had allegedly stolen cake from the school kitchen Trunchbull forces him to eat an enormous cake in one sitting, and is furious when he manages to succeed without getting sick She gives the whole student body a five-hour detentionThe next day, Miss Trunchbull's car breaks down and she takes her anger out on Matilda, simply because she is Mr Wormwood's daughter Matilda is put in the Chokey, a small closet in Trunchbull's office studded with nails on the inside, forcing its inhabitant to stand poker-straight Miss Honey's class prepares for a lecture from the headmistress, who visits classrooms sporadically to intimidate the children up close Matilda's friend Lavender gets revenge on Trunchbull by hiding a newt in the water pitcher on the teachers desk While Miss Trunchbull menaces the students, Miss Honey rescues Matilda from the Chokey and brings her back to class After Trunchbull drinks a glass of water she spots the newt, causing her to have an uncharacteristically childish panic attack when she sees it She instantly blames Matilda for the newt in the glass Matilda is furious and, using the same angry energy from the television explosion, manages to tip the glass over with her eyes, sending the newt flying onto Trunchbull Trunchbull blames Matilda again but Miss Honey points out that Matilda had never left her seat After the disgruntled headmistress leaves, Matilda tells Miss Honey that she had indeed tipped the glass over using her eyes She cannot repeat the phenomenon in the moment, but Matilda knows she has a strange mental power that had also caused her parents' television to explode

the ship Krill discovers that Ryback is really a Chief Petty Officer and former Navy SEAL with extensive special-weapons and counter-terrorism training He was relegated to his current posting for

clearance and was only able to serve as a yeoman or a cook To keep the missile-theft plan in place, Krill decides to activate the fire sprinklers in the forecastle, leaving the crew members to drown

his friends about him When the crook pleads to know 'what' this creature is, the costumed man replies, I'm BatmanWhen the two crooks are found by the Police, Lt Eckhardt shows up at the scene, dismissing their description of a man dressed up like a bat However, the crime scene is soon found by Alexander Knox, a reported for Gotham City's newspaper, who has been following the 'bat attacks' Knox has so far counted 8 sightings in under a month, and asks Eckhardt if it's true that Police Commissioner Gordon has opened a file Eckhardt just dismisses the 'oddball' reporterMeanwhile, the Mayor of Gotham City has held a press conference, introducing the city's new District Attorney, Harvey Dent Harvey promises to clean up Gotham, and make it a place for respectable people once again This press conference comes just weeks before the 200th Anniversary Gala celebrating the birth of Gotham CityBack at the Gotham newspaper, Knox meets one of the paper's new photographers, Vicki Vale Knox is mildly interested in her, but then grows even moreso when she tells of her interest in trying to find out who Batman is Knowing that Commissioner Gordon has a file on this vigilante, Knox intends to get into a charity benefit at Millionaire Bruce Wayne's mansion, where Gordon will be attending Vale also decides to accompany himMeanwhile, Crime Boss Carl Grissom is angered at the persistence of Harvey Dent, figuring that the new District Attorney could find out about their connection to the Axis Chemicals plant One of Carl's men, Jack Napier, nonchalantly suggests they break in and steal the files that could incriminate them Carl takes to this idea, and recommends that Jack is the man for the job Jack is reluctant, but Carl insists, calling him his number one guyMeanwhile, at the charity benefit, Knox attempts to get information from Gordon, but fails, with the Commissioner denying that there is a Batman on the streets Vicki, meanwhile, meets up with Bruce Wayne, who seems a little shy Bruce eventually excuses himself when his butler Alfred requests his presence In a secret command center, Bruce reviews video footage of the party, and catches Gordon

Chemicals, Napier's men find the plant's safeonly to find the documents they came for are gone Suspecting a setup, Jack cautions his men to watch out Shortly thereafter, they are ambushed by Eckhardt and his officers Gordon shows up shortly after the gunfire, and demands that Jack Napier be taken alive During the chase, Batman eventually corners Napier, and catches him just before he falls into a vat of chemicals However, Batman lets go, and Jack falls in Gordon sees Batman, and orders him to halt, but the Caped Crusader gets away Gordon then instructs his men not to mention what they sawThe next day, Napier's death is ruled as a suicide, but Knox suspects that Batman ended up taking care of Grissom's man Knox asks Vicki to help him further investigate the case, but she blows him off, saying she has a date with Bruce WayneMeanwhile, Jack Napier has managed to survive, and makes his way to a seedy doctor to have his face repaired However, the chemicals he fell into have permanently bleached his skin white, and turned his hair green As well, his face seems frozen in a permanent grin Jack then returns to Grissom's penthouse, having concluded that he had Eckhardt tip off the

Lowery tells Marion to put the money in the safe deposit box at the bank until Monday Pleading a headache, Marion asks to take the rest of the day off after her errand to the bankBut Marion doesn't go to the bank On the spur of the moment, she decides to keep the money, packs a suitcase, and starts driving out of town, only to be spotted by her boss at an intersection where he gives her a suspicious look Worried that she has been found out already, she still proceeds out of town on her way to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives All the while she keeps looking behind her, fearful that she's being followed She drives well into the night and parks alongside the road to sleepIn the morning, a highway patrolman Mort Mills stops to investigate her stopped car, and awakens her Startled and nervous, she arouses the patrolman's suspicions He looks at her license and registration, taking note of the plate number He allows her to go on, but follows her for a while, which intensifies

for a likely substitute, and completes the deal as the same highway patrolman watches from across the street Nervous, she drives away and continues toward FairvaleAs night falls on this second day, with her fears of pursuit crowding in around her, she drives into a rainstorm Unable to see the road clearly, she spots the lighted sign of the Bates Motel, and decides to take a room for the night As there are no other cars there, and no one in the motel office, she honks her horn upon seeing a light on in the house behind the motel, and a silhouette in the window Someone dashes down the path to greet her, and he introduces himself as Norman Bates Anthony Perkins He is soft-spoken and shy young man who tells Marion that he lives in the large house with his mother He comments that the motel seldom has guests anymore since the new interstate bypassed the local highway, and Marion realizes that she probably took a wrong turn in the storm Still nervous about being tracked by the police,

his supper with her so she doesn't have to go out again in the rain, and he goes back to the house She begins unpacking, taking time to wrap the money inside a newspaper which she sets aside on the

the life of 21-year-old Ben Braddock Dustin Hoffman shortly after earning his bachelor's degree from an unnamed college in the Northeast The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening creditsThe movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college Mrs Robinson Anne Bancroft, the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does We never learn Mrs Robinson's first name or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents during the course of the film in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs Robinson's first name is GArriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him This scene, known as the Mrs Robinson, you are trying to seduce me scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing Mr Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything Initially flustered and shocked by her advances, Benjamin flees into the nightA few days later Benjamin contacts Mrs Robinson and clumsily organizes a tryst at a hotel beginning their affair A now confident and relaxed Benjamin spends the summer drifting around in the pool by day and seeing Mrs Robinson at the hotel by night Benjamin is clearly uncomfortable with sexuality, but he is drawn into the affair with the older, but still attractive, Mrs Robinson Their affair appears to last most of the summer All of their scenes pass in a musically-backed montage, showing the endless pass of time One scene is edited so that it appears Benjamin is walking directly from his parents' dining room into the hotel room he shares with Mrs Robinson This seems to accent the separation of he and his parents, though they still live under the same roof Benjamin discovers that they have nothing to talk about but, she refuses to talk and only wants sex After pestering her one evening, Mrs Robinson tells Benjamin that she was forced to give up college and marry someone she didn't love when she became pregnant with her daughter ElaineMeanwhile, Benjamin is hounded by his father to select a graduate school to attend Benjamin, clearly not interested in pursuing his studies, shrugs off his father's wishes and spends his time lounging about and sleeping with Mrs Robinson His affair may serve as an escape from his lack of direction or ambition, and his fear and anxiety of his impending future Mr Robinson, unaware of his wife's budding affair, encourages Benjamin to call on his daughter, Elaine Katharine Ross Benjamin's parents also repeatedly encourage him to date her During one liaison, Mrs Robinson forces a promise from Ben to never date Elaine Whether out of fear of Mrs Robinson, or sensing that getting involved with the daughter of his lover could be disastrous, he tries to avoid it However, because of the three parents' persistent intervention, he is essentially forced to date herTherefore, he tries to ensure his date with her will be a disaster so she would not want to pursue a relationship with him He drives recklessly, practically ignoring Elaine, and then takes her to a strip club

years, in conjunction with a planetary arrangement, a 'Great Evil' appears whose purpose is to destroy life In preparation for the next appearance in 2263, a group of aliens called the Mondoshawan arrive on Earth in 1914 to extract the only weapon capable of defeating the Great Evil, a collection of four stones representing the Classical Elements and the eponymous Fifth Element that conjugates the other four into organic life After taking the weapons, the Mondoshawans present a key to a priest and tell him to pass the information provoking their mission through future generations in preparation for the Evil's arrivalIn 2263, the Great Evil appears and destroys an interplanetary battleship When the Mondoshawans attempt to deliver the Elements back to Earth, they are ambushed by another alien race, the shape-shifting Mangalores Earthly scientists are able to recover a portion of the Fifth Element and use a reconstitution device to recreate it, whereupon it takes the form of an apparently human woman named Leeloo described as the perfect being Leeloo, terrified of her unfamiliar environs, escapes the scientists and arrives in the care of taxi driver Korben Dallas, a former major in the Federated Army's Special Forces Dallas then delivers her to Priest Vito Cornelius, the current holder of the Mondoshawans' knowledge Dallas, Cornelius, and his acolyte David help Leeloo recover, though Dallas is forced out of Cornelius' apartment before learning her purpose Cornelius learns from Leeloo that the four Elements were not carried by the Mondoshawans but instead entrusted to Diva Plavalaguna, a singer currently performing on a luxury space liner at Fhloston Paradise, and that Leeloo must recover the stones from her Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg has attempted to gain the stones as urged by communication with the Great Evil After learning that the Mangalores' attack on the Mondoshawans was unsuccessful in recovering the stones, Zorg betrays and kills them, whereupon the surviving Mangalores decide to extract revenge and gain the stones for themselvesDallas is later met at his apartment by his General Munro, who informs him that he has been drafted into the Army in order to travel to meet the Diva, having rigged the annual Gemini Croquette Contest to allow Dallas to win Their meeting is interrupted by the arrival of Cornelius and Leeloo Dallas, learning of Leeloo's need, offers to help, but is knocked out by Cornelius, who steals his winning transportation tickets and departs with Leeloo Dallas accepts the job from General Munro and travels to John F Kennedy International Airport, intercepting Cornelius, David, and Leeloo before they board their flight, and escorts Leeloo The Mangalores and Zorg's assistant are rebuffed by the ticketing agent when they try to pose as Dallas Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple and then sneaks aboard the passenger spaceplane before it leavesOn the flight, Dallas meets interstellar radio personality Ruby Rhod, who escorts him for being the contest winner Upon arrival at Fhloston Paradise, Dallas is taken by Ruby to prepare for the show, while Leeloo waits near the Diva's quarters in order to retrieve the stones from her after her performance The Diva's show is interrupted by the Mangalores, and the Diva is fatally shot Dallas learns from her dying words that the Diva has hidden the stones inside her body after she dies, Dallas extracts them, giving them to Ruby to hold as he defeats the Mangalores and saves the rest of the passengers and crew Leeloo is able to defeat the Mangalores that attempt to ransack the Diva's quarters Zorg, having flown himself to Fhloston, fights Leeloo at the Diva's quarters, injuring her and forcing her

investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolenClouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton Christopher Plummer, the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees this as his only chance to get his revenge on Litton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison in the first Pink Panther film Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads into the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin After staking out, and nearly demolishing, the Litton Manor in Nice, Clouseau is tricked into leaving France He follows Sir Charles'

young son Max Justin Cooper they often play a game where Fletcher makes his hand into the Claw and pretends to chase Max with it But Fletcher has a habit of giving precedence to his job, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife Audrey Maura Tierney, and then lying about the reasons Fletcher's compulsive lying has also built him a reputation as one of the best defense lawyers in the state of California as he is climbing the ladder in the firm for which he works Ultimately, Fletcher misses his son's 5th birthday party because he is having sex with his boss Miranda Amanda Donohoe Max makes a birthday wish that I wish that for just one day Dad can't tell a lie Immediately, that wish actually and magically comes trueFletcher, through a series of embarrassing incidents, finds that he is unable to lie, mislead, or even withhold a true answer He blurts out exactly what he is thinking, like a Tourette's Syndrome twitch Some of these instances include Immediately after Max makes his wish, Fletcher has just had sex with Miranda and when she asks was it good for you I've had better, he respondsThe plot is reminiscent of The Twilight Zone episode The Whole Truth, which involves a used car salesman being forced into uninhibited honesty by a haunted carThe next morning, when an attractive girl says everyone is so nice to her, he says Well, that's because you have big jugs I mean your boobs are huge I mean I wanna squeeze em'Also when he walks out of the elevator at his office and everyone is plugging their nose, he admits It was me When an obese man asks What's up, he says, Your cholesterol Dead man walkin' He also tells a co-worker he doesn't know his name because he's not important enough When he tries to explain his situation to his secretary Greta Anne Haney, she doesn't believe him so he sets himself up good He tells her to ask him something she thinks he would normally lie about Greta asks him about a raise she wanted a couple months ago Fletcher had told her if he gave her a raise from his own pocket it would make the other secretaries jealous so the company wouldn't allow it She asks if that was true or if he just didn't want to pony up the dough Greta immediately quitsThese incidents are inconvenient, as he is fighting a divorce case in court which, should he win, could be a huge boost to his career His client is Samantha Cole Jennifer Tilly a young woman who wants a quick divorce after 14 years of marriage His main witness is willing to commit perjury to win, but Fletcher discovers that he cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer will be a lie during the case he even objects to himself when he tries to lie to get the desired informationMeanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her new boyfriend Jerry Cary Elwes, and decides that Max is going with them so that she can protect him from getting hurt by Fletcher It is here that Fletcher learns about Max's birthday wish and goes to confront him Fletcher tries to convince Max that adults need to lie as a part of their daily lives, but he cannot give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son Fletcher also figures out that since Max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day, he tries to do what he can to delay Samantha's case since the magic wish will expire at 815 pm 24 hours after Max made the wishFletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up, but he cannot conceal that he is able to continue, so Judge Marshall Stevens Jason Bernard insists that he does Finally, Fletcher discovers a loophole in his case he realizes that Samantha had lied about her age and therefore had signed her prenuptial agreement while she was only 17 still a minor, thus rendering it invalid This allows him to win his case truthfully, but the repercussions become a catalyst to his understanding of what he himself is"

Jonathan Filley and leads him away from the group to go skinny-dipping with her in the ocean Tom, quite drunk, passes out on the beach before he can even undress, but Chrissy, undeterred, strips down and dives into the surfAs Chrissy swims further from the shoreline, she pauses to tread water Ominous music plays as an unseen creature notices Chrissy's paddling legs from beneath the water's surface and begins to approach her Chrissy is quickly attacked by the creature, who grabs hold of her leg and violently drags her underwater Her screams for help go unheard, and eerie silence follows her submergenceThe surrounding community of Amity is preparing for the upcoming Independence Day weekend, their most financially beneficial point of the year The community depends on tourism as a major source of economic support and waits eagerly for each summer to arrive when herds of mainlanders come to savor Amity's shores Martin Brody Roy Scheider, Amity's Chief of Police, receives a call at home regarding Chrissie Watkins' disappearance Following the report made by Tom Cassidy that she was last seen off the coast, Brody goes to the beach with his deputy Jeff Hendricks Jeffrey Kramer to search for clues Hendricks soon stumbles upon the segmented remains of Chrissie, washed up on the shore and being feasted upon by crabsBack at the police station, Brody receives a call from the coroner Robert Nevin , who determines that Chrissie Watkins was the victim of a shark attack Fearing for the safety of Amity's many swimmers, Brody immediately prepares to close the beaches until further investigations can be made His intentions are quickly noticed by Mayor Larry Vaughn Murray Hamilton who, fearing for the income loss that would result from closing the beach at such a pivotal point in the summer, attempts to convince Brody that a shark attack is too hasty a conclusion, and pressures Brody and the coroner to change the Chrissie's official cause of death to being cut up by a boat propeller Brody remains dedicated to the safety of Amity's citizens and tourists, regardless of the financial toll the town might endure However, Vaughn prevents him from closing the beaches just yetOver the next few days, ferryloads of tourists arrive on Amity's shores The beaches are crowded each day, and Brody is extremely anxious that there will be another attack As Brody and his wife Ellen Lorraine Gary sit in the sand, Brody intently scans the shoreline for any sign of trouble A ways down the beach, young Alex Kitner Jeffrey Voorhees asks his mother for permission to go swimming Though Mrs Kitner Lee Fierro notes that her son's fingers are starting to prune from the time he has already spent in the water that day, she allows him ten more minutes Alex and his yellow raft enter the ocean one last time before Alex is attacked by what is unmistakably an enormous shark The other swimmers panic and rush out of the water, while the bloodied and shredded remains of Alex Kitner's raft wash up in the surf Mrs Kitner calls out desperately for her son, unaware that he has just been killedWith dozens of witnesses to Alex Kitner's gruesome death, the presence of a shark in Amity waters is certain and Brody is finally permitted to close the beaches Alex's grieving mother issues a 3000 reward to anyone who can catch the shark that killed her son, and a town meeting is held to discuss the official shark problem While Brody explains that the police department is expanding their efforts to keep the beaches safe and bringing in a shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute to assist them, most of the assembled townspeople are simply angry about the beaches being closed, although Mayor Vaughn assures them it will only be for 24 hours The chatter is quelled by Sam

that all she ever wanted was to help the children, not hurt them, and that more than anything, she loves childrenIn the first scene, Miss Giddens Deborah Kerr is applying for a job as a governess It is her first position, but the wealthy bachelor interviewing her Michael Redgrave is unconcerned with her lack of experience He values his freedom to travel and socialize and unabashedly confesses that he has no room, mentally or emotionally for his niece and nephew, who were orphaned and left in his care as infants His previously employed governess, Miss Jessel, died suddenly less than a year ago and he is desperate to find someone else to teach the children and keep them company He says that all he cares about is that she accepts full responsibility for the children and does not trouble him with whatever problems may arise Miss Giddens is instantly charmed by her suave employer and promises to do her best, assuring him that she loves children above all else and that she has an imagination, making her ideal to work with childrenUpon arriving at Bry, the sprawling English estate where The Uncle keeps the children, Miss Giddens hears a woman's voice calling for Flora, the little girl Moments later, she meets Flora, and is instantly taken with the bright, quirky child She also forges a fast friendship with Mrs Groce Megs Jenkins, the kindly housekeeper The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, though Flora delightedly insists her brother is coming home Sure enough, Miss Giddens receives a letter saying that Miles has been expelled from school because of his bad influence on the other boys Mrs Groce says she can't imagine Miles being a bad influence, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too feels sure his teachers must have exaggerated Apart from evading all her questions about his experience at school, she finds Miles as enchanting as Flora At first he seems polite, composed, and mature -- perhaps even too mature, with his flirtatious flattery toward the pretty Miss GiddensWhile tending to the rose bushes the next day, Miss Giddens sees the shadowy figure of a man standing atop one of Bry's towers When she climbs the stairs to investigate she finds only Miles, playing with the pigeons, who insists he saw no oneOn a rainy day Miss Giddens forgoes the day's schooling to play hide-and-seek with the restless children While searching for them, she sees a woman cross the hall in front of her and disappear Searching the attic, she stumbles across a photograph of a darkly handsome man, and is gazing at it when Miles sneaks up on her and wrestles her playfully Miss Giddens tells him to stop, that he is hurting her, but he doesn't stop until Flora bursts in on them and tells Miss Giddens to go hide She goes to hide downstairs behind the curtains, and through the window she sees a man leering at her The figure is gone by the time Mrs Groce comes to investigate her screams When describing the man to Mrs Groce, Miss Giddens realizes the man in the window was the same she saw in the photograph Mrs Groce explains that the man in the photograph is Peter Quint, who served as valet there before he died, presumably of head trauma from tripping on the stairs outside She mentions that Miles was intensely devoted to Quint, that he absolutely worshipped him and trailed him everywhere like a dog, much as Flora latched onto Miss JesselMiss Giddens is yet more disturbed when she sees a mysterious woman from across the pond She is certain that Flora can see her as well, though the little girl evades her

narrated by Nagiko Vivian Wu, a Japanese born model living in Hong Kong Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father Ken Ogata would write characters of good fortune on her face Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt Hideko Yoshida reads a list of beautiful things from Sei Shnagon's the book of observations Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty-eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Shnagon when she had written the book in addition to sharing her first name Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher, Yaji-san Yoshi Oida, who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his workEarly chaptersThe publisher arranges Nagiko's wedding to his young apprentice Her husband Ken Mitsuishi, an expert archer, resents Nagiko's love for books and her desire to read, in spite of his apprenticeship He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure, refusing to write on her body When he discovers and reads Nagiko's pillow book, he is extremely resentful, setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home, an event which Nagiko describes to be the 'first major fire of her life' Insulted and enraged, Nagiko leaves him for goodHiding from her husband, Nagiko moves to Hong Kong In spite of her aversion to the practice, she learns how to type to find work Outside her apartment, a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the depletion of forests due to the need to make paperAfter working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while, Nagiko's employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models As a successful fashion model, Nagiko hires a maid Hideko Yoshida again, as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on However, after several affairs, she feels dissatisfied with them all either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers, or vice-versaOne day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko's favourite haunt, she meets Jerome Ewan McGregor, a British translator Intrigued by his knowledge, they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders

Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies One of the activists, admirer Hoki Yutaka Honda, a Japanese photographer who adores her, begs Nagiko to take him as a lover She explains she can't, as his skin's no good for writing whenever she writes on him, the ink smears and runs Hoki, not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is, suggests she try writing

prison term, decides to have himself declared insane so he'll be transferred to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his term free of prison labor and in comparative comfort and luxuryHis ward in the mental institution is run by an unyielding tyrant, Nurse Ratched Fletcher, who has cowed the patients most of whom are voluntary or there by choice into dejected institutionalized submission McMurphy becomes ensnared in a number of power games with Nurse Ratched for the hearts and minds of the patients All the time, however, the question is just how sane any of the players in the ward actually are and whether they really belong thereThroughout his stay at the hospital, McMurphy forms friendships with his fellow patients but the bonds are deepest with two in particular Billy Bibbit Dourif, a suicidal, stuttering manchild whom Ratched has humiliated and dominated into a quivering mess and Chief Bromden Sampson, a 6'5 muscular Native American who has schizophrenia Recognized by the patients in the ward as deaf, and unable to speak, they ignore him but also respect him for his enormous size In the former, McMurphy sees a younger brother figure whom he wants to teach to have fun, while the latter is his only real confidant, as they both understand what it is like to be treated into submissionMcMurphy initially insults Chief when he enters the ward, but attempts to use his size as an advantage for example, in playing basketball, for which his height is favorable When Mac sees how submissive the patients are under Ratched's tyrannical control, he resolves to antagonize her and undermine her authority as much as possible At a counseling session, McMurphy proposes that the ward's work schedule be altered so that the patients can watch the World Series on television When the 1st meeting comes to a halt under Ratched's authority, Mac takes wagers on whether he can lift the ward's marble water-treatment control panel and throw it through a window to escape and watch the Series at a bar He naturally fails, but puts forth an extreme effortThe next discussion over changing the work detail quickly becomes a battle of wills when Ratched announces that a majority vote will be acceptable However, Ratched, upon realizing that the vote may go McMurphy's way, deftly alters the rules, stating that votes must be taken from the Chronic and Vegetable patients When the vote doesn't favor McMurphy, he begins to imagine the game is on TV and rallies most of the other patients behind him, causing a major ruckusMcMurphy leads the patients in a basketball game against the ward's orderlies Chief Bromden proves to be an effective player, scoring several baskets While the orderlies claim that the patients are cheating, McMurphy ignores their objections While the patients later relax in the hospital pool, Mac finds out, from an orderly, that he won't be released at the end of his prison sentence, but will remain in the hospital for as long as the board and Ratched deem necessaryAnother counseling session ensues and McMurphy, very upset at the orderly's revelation, finds out that he's been listed as a committed patient and will only be released when Ratched permits it, a highly unlikely scenario Murphy also discovers that many of the patients in the ward are there voluntarily they can leave any time they wish but due to Ratched's dominance, they are afraid to take the chance McMurphy seems particularly upset that a young man like Billy remains on the ward voluntarily when he could be free and maybe enjoying his youthThe session quickly erupts in violence however, when the subject of Ratched's cigarette rationing is addressed by an upset patient named Charlie Cheswick A fight breaks out with the

these warlords is Simon Phoenix Wesley Snipes, who has recently kidnapped 30 people after their city bus violated his territory As the LAPD lay siege to Phoenix's hideout, Sgt John Spartan Sylvester Stallone aka The Demolition Man, who has been chasing Phoenix for two years, rappels in from a helicopter, against orders After defeating Phoenix's gang, Spartan holds Phoenix at gunpoint and demands to know the location of the hostages Phoenix simply says the hostages are gone and begins setting off explosives throughout the building Spartan subdues Phoenix and escapes the building with him, just as a final series of explosions causes it to collapse Outside, Spartan is berated by his superiors for going in against orders, destroying another building the origin of his nickname and placing the hostages at risk Spartan insists he took a heat signature scan of the building before he went in and only found enough people to be Phoenix's gang members However, the fire chief approaches them and says he has found 30 bodies in the wreckage Phoenix, as he is being led away, also says Spartan knew they were there but didn't care Spartan is arrested for involuntary manslaughterAfter their respective trials, Phoenix and Spartan are incarcerated in a cryoprison, which keeps its prisoners cryonically frozen in suspended animation During a parole hearing in 2032, Phoenix escapes and soon thereafter embarks on a reign of terror throughout the city of San Angeles the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara having merged after the big earthquake of 2012 As the city has long since become a utopia, police officers no longer know how to deal with violent criminals Spartan, who had been sentenced to 36 years, is therefore paroled early from the cryoprison for the purpose of apprehending PhoenixAs he searches for Phoenix, Spartan discovers that the mayorgovernor of San Angeles, Dr Raymond Cocteau, engineered the escape of Simon Phoenix in order to have him kill Edgar Friendly, leader of an underground resistance movement at odds with Cocteau's facist-like system of government To this end, Phoenix was given extensive training while in cryostasis, including computer hacking and paramilitary skills Friendly's resistance movement, dubbed The Scraps, is made up of homeless people and refugees living on the margin of society in the underground ruins of the old city, periodically raiding the surface for foodAfter seeing the exchange on security cameras, Spartan and Huxley check prison records and determine that Cocteau programmed Phoenix to make him an even more dangerous criminal and assassin, with the goal of eliminating Friendly While Spartan and Huxley enter the underground to warn Friendly, Phoenix confronts Cocteau and demands that he release other prisoners to assist him Phoenix and his gang attempt to kill both Spartan and Friendly, but Friendly has retained his combat skills, and the two of them and Huxley drive them offAfter being attacked in their underground base, Friendly and his Scraps decide to team with Huxley and Spartan against Phoenix and his new criminal gangUnfortunately for Cocteau, he did not anticipate that the SAPD would revive Spartan in order to try to stop Phoenix He also underestimated Phoenix's criminal genius, much as Spartan had Phoenix was conditioned in cryostasis not to kill Cocteau, but eventually he simply directs another revived criminal to do so Before Lenina Huxley and John Spartan discover Dr Cocteau dead they fight a couple of Simon Phoenix's thugs Lenina Huxley knocks out one thug and shoots the other one killing him as it appears to be the first time she ever killed someone and it appears that Huxley and Spartan drive off 2 more henchmen to Phoenix Phoenix then takes control of the

conflicts in Jim's family situation are introduced as he explains to the arresting officer His parents are often fighting His weak-willed father Jim Backus often tries to defend Jim, but Jim's picky and domineering mother always wins the arguments for his father cannot find the courage to stand up to his wife Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father's lack of moral strength, causing feelings of unrest and displacement This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father, What do you do when you have to be a manThe next day, while trying to conform with fellow students at the school, he becomes involved in a dispute with a local bully named Buzz Gunderson Corey Allen While Jim tries to deal with Buzz, he becomes friends with a shy 15-year-old boy,

musical has become pass As the movie opens, a Hollywood memorabilia auctioneer tries to sell off a hat and cane that once belonged to Hunter, but he literally can't get 50 cents for them His star on the wane, his life at a crossroads, Tony travels to New York by train to take stock and ponder his future When the train pulls into Grand Central Terminal, he thinks the gaggle of reporters on the platform is there to see him, but it turns out they were waiting for Ava Gardner, who was also on board A deflated but amused Tony strolls off alone song By Myself''Tony's solitude is short-lived -- he receives a raucous welcome inside the station by two of his best friends, Lily and Lester Marton Nanette Fabray, Oscar Levant, a Broadway show-writing couple They want Tony to star in a brand-new stage musical they've just completed, and they know who they want to direct it acclaimed actor-director Jeffery Cordova Jack Buchanan, who currently has five shows running on Broadway, including Oedipus Rex, which he's starring in himself Tony, who's never heard of Cordova, listens politely as they stroll along 42nd Street, which Tony barely recognizes after all these years He sends the Martons ahead to dinner in a taxi so he can spend some quality time in an arcade song A Shine on Your Shoes''The Martons take Tony to Oedipus Rex, where they watch from the wings Tony has trouble believing the star and director of such a serious work would want to do a musical Tony meets Cordova, who's a little slow to recognize him but then expresses great excitement at the prospect of working with him Tony asks Cordova if he's truly interested in producing a musical Cordova insists all theatrical genres are valuableThe Martons pitch the idea of their light, frothy musical Tony would play an author of children's books who feels he's compromised himself artistically by writing lurid yet lucrative murder mysteries on the side Lily says his success makes him feel as though he's sort of sold his soul to the Devil'' Jeffrey seizes upon that phrase to offer his vision of what the musical should be a modern retelling of Faust, with himself playing the Devil in the guise of a book publisher Lily, Les and Tony are taken aback Tony doesn't think it will be his kind of musical, but Jeffrey tells him the show will make him a star all over again As for Tony's insistence that he's just an entertainer,'' Jeffrey replies that they're all entertainers song That's Entertainment'' Cordova sets about lining up financial backers for the play He also knows who he wants as the leading lady a rising ballet star named Gabrielle Gerard Cyd Charisse, even though it's well known that her mentor and boyfriend, Paul Byrd James Mitchell, won't let her do a Broadway show Cordova solves that problem by offering Paul the job of choreographing the musical, and finagling Paul into demanding that Gabrielle co-star, or he won't do it Tony, who goes with the Martons to see Gabrielle perform, thinks she's fabulous but is apprehensive about starring opposite a classically trained -- and noticeably tall -- ballerina As it turns out, Gabrielle is nervous about working with a Hollywood legend like Tony Their initial meeting goes badly amid mutual misunderstandings, but by this time the investors are totally sold on the concept, and it's too late to back outWork begins on the musical, to be called The Band Wagon Tony feels out of his element, and worse, that he's being patronized by Jeffrey, Paul and Gabrielle He finally storms out of rehearsal Lily and Les are concerned about their friend, but end up getting into their own argument with Les accusing Lily of being overly enthralled by Jeffrey The Martons continue to work on the show -- but refuse to talk

and is compelled to leave As he heads to his car, Nash is confronted by a man named Iman Fasil Fasil identifies Nash by his real name, Connor MacLeod, and challenges him to a duel Connor reluctantly accepts, and draws a katana After a fierce sword fight, Connor decapitates Fasil and is enveloped by a mysterious energy which destroys several cars around him He quickly hides his sword in one of the light racks hanging from the ceiling Before he can leave the garage he is arrested by the police, who take him for questioningThe story goes back to Scotland in 1536, where an 18-year old Connor is seen with his fiance, Kate Celia Imrie, and war weary cousins Angus James Cosmo and Dugal Billy Hartman Their clan is preparing for war against their longtime rivals, Clan FraserDetectives Moran Alan North and Garfield Edward Wiley are attempting to interrogate Connor Garfield loses his cool and assaults Connor This incident, coupled with lack of evidence, results in Connor's release Forensics expert Brenda Wyatt Roxanne Hart is intrigued by Fasil's sword, as it is a very valuable historical artifact, probably worth over a million dollars Later, Connor returns to the garage to retrieve the katana, but before he does he sees that Brenda is looking at the crime scene She finds some metal shards embedded in a nearby concrete column and saves them for analysisThe scene returns to the Highlands, where the armies of Clan Fraser and Clan MacLeod are preparing to face each other in battle Clan Fraser's leader, Chief Murdoch Alistair Findlay, has taken on the services of the Kurgan Clancy Brown, a imposing mercenary in black leather armor The Kurgan tells Murdoch that he wants to kill Connor on the battlefield and that nobody else should fight him The battle begins and Connor, who has never been in battle before, is very scared He soon finds nobody wants to fight him, but eventually the Kurgan finds him and easily defeats Connor by stabbing him in the chest, shouting there are can be only one Dugal and Angus see the Kurgan preparing to decapitate Connor and attack him, forcing him to retreat Connor is taken back to the village but is so badly wounded everybody assumes he is going to dieWe learn that Connor, in his Russell Nash persona, is an antiquities dealer and seems to be quite wealthy A very pretty older woman named Rachel Ellenstein Sheila Gish is his assistant Later, the Kurgan, now wearing Judas Priest stagewear and sporting a hideous scar on his neck, drives into the city after hearing of Fasil's death Using the alias Victor Kruger, he takes up residence at a seedy motel and assembles his sectional bastard sword, made from composite alloys He practices his technique, taking the occasional break for dalliances with prostitutesConnor follows Brenda to a bar where they strike up a conversation and Brenda becomes very interested in him They both leave and as Brenda tries to follow Connor he is attacked by Kruger They fight but Connor is at an obvious disadvantage without a sword The fight is interrupted by a police helicopter and everybody fleesConnor has made a remarkable recovery and is now back to normal, in only a few days While he is happy to be alive, his friends ostracize him Kate says that his recovery is the work of the devil Most everybody in the clan mirrors that sentiment Eventually the townspeople form a mob, tie him to a pole, and take him out to be executed -- but Angus frees him, convincing the villagers to commute the death sentence in favor of exileBrenda has analyzed the metal fragments and discovered them to be extremely unusual She makes a date with Connor and they plan to meet at her apartment Although she tries to make it seem like it's only a date, she actually is trying to entrap him she has a

December 1941, the Moroccan coastal city of Casablanca attracts people from all over the world, particularly Nazi-occupied Europe Many are transients trying to get out of Europe a few are just trying to make a buck Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf Amricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine Humphrey Bogart Though we learn later that Rick once harbored enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached I stick my neck out for nobodyUgarte Peter Lorre comes to Rick's with letters of transit he obtained by killing two German couriers The papers allow the bearer to travel freely around German-controlled Europe, including to neutral Lisbon, Portugal from Lisbon, it's relatively easy to get to the United States They are almost priceless to any of the refugees stranded in Casablanca Ugarte plans to make his fortune by selling them to the highest bidder, who is due to arrive at the club later that night However, before the exchange can take place, Ugarte is arrested by the police under the command of Captain Louis Renault Claude Rains A corrupt Vichy official, Renault accommodates the Nazis Unknown to Renault and the Nazis, Ugarte had left the letters with Rick for safekeeping, because somehow, just because you despise me, you're the only one I trustThen the reason for Rick's bitterness re-enters his life Ilsa Lund Ingrid Bergman arrives with her husband Victor Laszlo Paul Henreid to purchase the letters Laszlo is a renowned Czech Resistance leader who has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp They must have the letters to escape to America to continue his work At the time Ilsa first met and fell in love with Rick in Paris, she believed her husband had been killed When she discovered that he was still alive, she left Rick abruptly without explanation and returned to Laszlo, leaving Rick feeling betrayed After the club closes, Ilsa returns to try to explain, but Rick is drunk and bitterly refuses to listenAt different times Rick and Ilsa torment themselves by asking the club's piano player, Sam Arthur Dooley Wilson, to play As Time Goes By, a song they loved when they were together in Paris The famous line Play it again, Sam, which refers to this song, doesn't actually appear in the movie -- Ilsa says Play it, Sam, and later, Rick orders Play it While Sam plays the song, Rick reminisces about his affair with Ilsa in Paris Though she seems happy to be with Rick, her mood near the end of their time together is cautious because she has learned her husband may not be dead When the Nazis begin to close in on Paris, she receives word that Victor is indeed alive in another part of Europe She and Rick had been planning to take a train to Southern France to escape the German Army's assault however, on the platform Rick receives a handwritten letter from her She writes that she can't explain why she's leaving him but she loves him Rick and Sam leave without herThe next night, Laszlo, suspecting that Rick has the letters, speaks with him privately

slowly through space Inside is Ripley Sigourney Weaver, the only survivor from the previous film, having escaped in the shuttle of the cargo ship Nostromo, which she blew up after an aggressive and hostile alien species was responsible for killing her colleagues Ripley is still in cryogenic sleep with Jones, the crew's pet cat, lying on top of her A proximity alert goes off the lifeboat is intercepted by a salvage vessel The crew uses a welding torch to open the door and enters, finding that Ripley is still aliveIn Gateway Station, a space facility orbiting Earth, Ripley regains consciousness in a hospital A nurse tells her she is in a medical bay She is visited by Carter Burke Paul Reiser, a representative of Weyland-Yutani the Company from the previous film, and Ripley's employer who brings Jones the cat along When Ripley states that she does not recognize the medical bay, Burke gives her some terrible news she has been in hypersleep for 57 years, her ship having drifted aimlessly through space until the salvage vessel discovered it by very fortunate coincidence Ripley shows clear distress and discomfort, when Jones starts hissing at her as she starts to convulse in the bed Burke calls for medical attention, and the staff try to restrain Ripley She pleads with them to kill her, before pulling her shirt up to reveal something pushing out of her stomach Ripley suddenly wakes up bolt-upright in the hospital bed, clutching her chest, revealing the scene to be a nightmare A nurse on the monitor next to her bed asks her if she needs something to help her sleep, but Ripley declines The nurse was the one featured in her dream the dream was a recollection from a real encounter with Burke, apart from the alien bursting outSome time later, Ripley is sitting in an simulated environment waiting for Burke, who wants to prepare her for a board hearing The Company has started a formal investigation into what happened with the Nostromo, and wants to question Ripley about her role in its destruction Ripley is only interested in news about her daughter Burke hesitantly hands her a picture of an old woman and tells a devastated Ripley that her daughter only a 10-year-old child when Ripley left with the Nostromo has passed away from cancer while she was drifting through spaceDuring the inquiry, Ripley desperately tries to convince the board of the dangerous nature of the Alien and the potential threat of the Derelict Ship, which still contains hundreds of eggs She explains that Company policies at the time gave the Nostromo crew orders to obtain the creature, which killed the crew and caused the destruction of the ship However, the board is extremely skeptical of Ripley's testimony Because she admits to having destroyed the Nostromo and evidence of the Alien creature is lacking, they treat her as if she is mentally unstable The board does not press criminal charges, but revokes her flight license and submits her to psychiatric supervision Upon asking why no one will go to the planetoid to confirm her story, Ripley is shocked to learn that the planetoid, now known as LV-426, has already been colonized by terraformers for 30 years, who are creating an atmosphere to make the air breathable and the planetoid habitableSome time thereafter, at the colony headquarters on LV-426, two Company employees discuss recently received Company orders to investigate a certain un-surveyed part of the surface of the planetoid A surveyor is currently doing the job, wondering if he can make a claim to anything he finds The higher-ranking man complains how they never got an answer to the question why those particular coordinates were so interesting, but assures that anything found can be claimed Outside on the barren and stormy planet

name all along Mitch is a lawyer who recognizes Melanie from a court appearance where one of her practical jokes backfired and resulted in a damaged window Melanie is incensed and uses Mitch's license

the graveyard from the house in Brooklyn where Mortimer grew up After the ceremony but before going on honeymoon to Niagara Falls, Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to the old Brewster house, now

onAunt Martha comes home, the Rev Harper leaves, and there are mysterious references to Teddy having to dig a new lock for the Panama Canal and looking in the window seat Before this is explained,

office drone for an insurance company in New York City Four different company managers take turns commandeering Baxter's apartment, which is located on West 67th Street on the Upper West Side, for their various extramarital liaisons Unhappy with the situation, but unwilling to challenge them directly, he juggles their conflicting demands while hoping to catch the eye of fetching elevator operator Fran Kubelik Shirley MacLaine Meanwhile the neighbors in the apartment building assume Baxter is a good time Charlie who brings home a different drunken woman every night Baxter accepts their criticism rather than reveal the truthThe four managers write glowing reports about Baxter a little too glowing, so personnel director Mr Sheldrake Fred MacMurray suspects something illicit behind the praise Sheldrake lets Baxter's promotion go unchallenged on condition that he be allowed to use the apartment as well, starting that night Sheldrake gives Baxter two tickets to The Music Man to ensure his absence Delighted about his promotion, Baxter asks Kubelik to meet him at the theatre She agrees and it is revealed to the audience that she is Sheldrake's girlfriend, intending to break off their affair that night but is instead charmed by Sheldrake to the apartment Baxter is disappointed at being stood up, but is willing to forgive KubelikAt an office party on Christmas Eve, Baxter discovers the relationship between Sheldrake and Kubelik, though he conceals this realization, while Kubelik learns from Sheldrake's secretary that she is merely the latest female employee to be his mistress, the secretary herself having filled that role several years earlier At the apartment, Kubelik confronts Sheldrake with this information and while he maintains that he genuinely loves her, he leaves to return to his family Meanwhile, a depressed Baxter picks up a woman in a local bar and, upon returning the apartment, is astounded to find Kubelik in his bed, fully clothed and overdosed on Baxter's sleeping pillsBaxter sends his bar pickup home and enlists the help of his neighbour, a physician, in reviving Kubelik without notifying the authorities The doctor makes various assumptions about Kubelik and Baxter, which Baxter concedes without revealing Sheldrake's involvement Baxter later telephones Sheldrake and informs him of the situation, and while Sheldrake professes gratitude for Baxter's quiet handling of the matter, he avoids any further involvement Kubelik recuperates in Baxter's apartment under his care for two days, during which he tries to entertain and distract her from any possible suicidal afterthoughts, talking her into playing numerous hands of gin rummy, though she is largely uninterestedBaxter and Kubelik's absence from work is noted and commented on, with Baxter's former customers assuming that Baxter and Kubelik were having an affair Kubelik's taxi-driver brother-in-law comes looking for her and two of the customers cheerfully direct him to Baxter's apartment, partly out of spite since he has been denying them access since his arrangement with Sheldrake The brother-in-law also assumes the worst of Baxter and punches him several timesSheldrake, angered at his secretary for sharing the truth with Kubelik, fires her She retaliates by telling his wife about his infidelities, leading to the breakup of the marriage Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club and continues to string Kubelik along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood Baxter finally takes a stand when Sheldrake demands the apartment for another liaison with Kubelik on New Year's Eve, which results in Baxter quitting the firm When Kubelik hears of this from Sheldrake, she realizes that Baxter is the man who truly loves her and abandons him, running to the apartment

allowed to serve in combat situations DeHaven plans to have a female naval officer enroll in SEAL training, one of the toughest training programs the US Military has to offer, with a 60 failure rate amongst its candidates She receives much resistance from the Naval representatives at the hearing, however she uses her influence to put her plan into actionThe candidate DeHaven handpicks is Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, who works in Naval communications as a satellite specialist O'Neill has been passed over for promotion within her division with many male coworkers having less experience than she does O'Neill is also romantically involved with one of her superior officers, Royce Tension arises between herself and Royce when she chooses to participate in the training courseO'Neill reports to the SEAL training facility and is immediately subject to ridicule and discrimination from her fellow candidates and the base's commanding colonel, who makes attempts to treat her delicately because she's a woman The facility's command master chief CMC, John Urgayle, addresses his candidates for the 1st time by reciting a poem, Self Pity, by DH Lawrence The trainees are then begin their hell week where they are subjected to extremely rigorous mental and physical conditions they are forced to push heavy ship fenders up sand dunes, exercise in cold water, hold heavy rafts over their heads for prolonged periods of time and are constantly ridiculed by Urgayle's staff When the training regimen becomes too much for a candidate they have the option of leaving the program voluntarily by ringing a ceremonial bell three timesHell week ends for the candidates when they are required to run a difficult obstacle course under live fire O'Neill is told that there will be a small set of wooden steps at a wall marking the end of the course, to make it easier for her to scale the wall The trainees, including O'Neill, make it to the wall O'Neill pushes the step unit aside and volunteers her own body to allow her fellow trainees to get over the wall The last trainee, Cortez, reaches his hand down to help O'Neill but keeps his grip just out of reach and then suggests she quit He is later punished for his actions O'Neill uses the stair unit to scale the wall and runs to join her comrades but misses a tripwire, signifying she may have killed some or all of the company Later, when Urgayle's staff reads of the candidates' times, O'Neill finds to her surprise she passed the course, even though she came in dead last, behind other candidates who didn't finish in the required 12 minute limit She's told that she was given a 30 second buffer, a concept they refer to as gender norming O'Neill meets directly with the base's colonel, who, never happy about the idea of a woman being allowed into SEAL training, tells her that he'd altered the program because she's a woman O'Neill requests that she be treated the same as the male candidates, including being allowed to take up residence in their barracks Her request is granted and she reports to the base's barber shop The barber isn't there and she shaves off her long hair herself and joins the men in their barracks After a brief argument with one of the other candidates, Urgayle orders the ranking officer, Wickwire, to rewrite the schedule to allow O'Neill privacy in the head and showerBack in Washington, O'Neill's success in hell week is reported to DeHaven It is revealed that DeHaven has also been generating publicity about O'Neill's candidacy but she has an ulterior motive she is using the incident as leverage to prevent the closing of military bases in her native Texas, but voting for base closings in other statesO'Neill continues through the rest of the program, learning how to use weapons, field

the 1979 Theatrical EditionThe opening credits appear in front of a large planet with rings Cut to the far reaches of deep space the Nostromo, a commercial towing space vehicle, carrying a refinery with twenty million tons of mineral ore, is en route to Earth with a crew of seven Inside, the ship appears eerily quiet, but suddenly, the onboard computer is activated Lights inside the ship are activated, and a room with 7 biobeds is illuminated The canopies open to wake the crew Executive Officer Kane John Hurt is the first to get out They congregate in the mess hall, where they cheerfully enjoy a meal Chief Engineer Parker Yaphet Kotto and Engineering Technician Brett Harry Dean Stanton take the opportunity to discuss the bonus system, which they find unfair, as they get paid less than the officers Captain Dallas Tom Skerritt is called away by Mother, the ship's computer, before they can have a meaningful conversation Dallas enters the Mother console room, and tries to assess the situation, as the rest of the crew gets in the cockpit of the ship to determine their location They quickly deduce that they are not home yet Navigator Lambert Veronica Cartwright finds out that they are at Zeta II Reticuli, and the ship is still quite far from Earth When Parker and Brett return from their round of the lower deck, complaining about their colleagues' attitude and the bonus system, Dallas briefs the crew the ship is not even halfway home, and has altered course because it has picked up an unknown signal, which repeats every 12 seconds The crew has been awoken from cryosleep to investigate Parker protests, arguing that they're not a rescue team and that they should be compensated for the extra work, but Science Officer Ash Ian Holm stipulates that per Company contract, the crew is obliged to investigate every signal from an intelligent source non-compliance will result in loss of pay, which quickly gets Parker in a cooperative moodThe crew assembles in the cockpit to listen to the signal It sounds very strange and unearthly, perhaps like a voice Lambert homes in on it and finds that it comes from a planetoid, 1200 km in diameter, with a 2 hour rotation and some gravityThe Nostromo approaches the planet, which is close to one enormous ringed planet and two smaller ones The ship separates from the refinery, and sets course to the planet's surface It descends toward the planet, but the landing is rough, causing damage that will take some time for Parker and Brett to fix although they allot themselves copious amounts of time The planet is windy, and visibility is low As the source of the signal is 2000 meters away and the sun is coming up, Dallas and Kane decide to investigate on foot A reluctant Lambert is ordered to join Ash takes place behind an outer window with a communication console, as the team puts on the space suits and leaves the ship to investigate the signal on the planet's windy surface In the meanwhile, Warrant Officer Ripley Sigourney Weaver has gone to the lower deck to inspect the repairs Parker and Brett ask if there will be a bonus for any discovery which is made on the surface Ripley assures them that the law guarantees them a share, before returning upstairs, as they keep teasing her Outside, the team walks between the rocks, through the planetoid's inhabitable atmosphere Inside the ship, Ash tells Ripley that Mother has not yet deciphered the signal she volunteers to give it a try Ripley accesses a console and starts working on the strange signalOutside, the sun is up and they wind has laid down The team clears the rock formation, and makes a fascinating discovery Near the horizon, they see a derelict spacecraft of unknown origin It is lying against the rocks, vaguely shaped like a horseshoe Despite Lambert's hesitation, they approach it, losing contact with the Nostromo upon entering the massive ship through an opening at the side Inside"

spacecraft have been reported launched from the planet Mars, and are on a course to Earth While General Decker Rod Steiger demands immediate Military deployment, Professor Donald Kessler Pierce Brosnan suggests that the General's protestations are uncalled for, claiming that they know very little about these aliens, and that this could be a new chapter for humanityThe President eventually has a newscast televised, in which the world is made aware of the Martian's impending arrival Professor Kessler is even brought onto a daytime news show, in which he is interviewed by newscaster Nathalie Lake Sarah Jessica Parker Nathalie's boyfriend Jason Stone Michael J Fox notes that she seems to be flirting with the Professor, when the news transmission goes out completely, and all television signals are blocked by a transmission from the MartiansIn the wake of this transmission, The President, Kessler, and several Generals hold a meeting in their war room to analyze what they know about the Martians A scientist also brings a machine that he claims has translated the Martians' speech patternsbut the translations barely make any senseEventually, it is indicated that the Martians will first land near the Nevada town of Pahrump A military escort is headed up by General Casey Paul Winfield, a more quiet and docile general than the more outspoken General Decker A number of spectators show up as well, as a ship lands Emerging from the ship, are 2 armed martians, and one in a sparkling red cloak After it is translated that he is the Martian Ambassador, and General Casey gives a greeting, a new sentence from the Martians claims they 'come in peace'This causes a group of hippies to release a dovewhich is quickly shot down by the Martians The scene then dissolves into chaos as the Martians vaporize and kill almost everyone The end up taking Nathalie Lake, her little chihuahua Poppy, and her handbag onto their ship, before leaving the massacre behindBack in Washington DC, General Decker demands that immediate action be taken, but Professor Kessler feels that what they witnessed could have been a cultural misunderstanding, due in part to the dove A message is sent out to the Martians, and a response is soon received The Martian Ambassador claims to feel remorse, and would like to appear before CongressThe request is granted, and one of the Martian's ships lands in front of the United States Capitol The ambassador and two armed Martians appear in Congress, and approach the podium After reading what appears to be a speech, the Martian Ambassador draws a gun that vaporizes two branches of the government Professor Kessler pleads for the ambassador to stop, but is quickly subdued, and eventually taken aboard the shipIn the aftermath of the attack, General Decker once again demands that affirmative action be taken, but the President still chooses to go about the situation with no action taken against the martiansfurther infuriating the GeneralAboard the Ambassador's ship, the Martians have also conducted medical experiments on Nathalie, Poppy, and the Professor Nathalie and Poppy's heads have been switched, with Nathalie's head now transplanted onto her chihuahua's body The Professor's body has been removed, with his vital organs still functioning, causing his head to remain alive The Professor's disembodied

Marsellus calls Vincent over and embraces him Marsellus is leaving town that evening and Vincent is to take Marsellus' wife, Mia Uma Thurman, out for dinner to keep her entertained Rumors abound that Marsellus gravely wounded another associate, Antoine, who he believed had been improperly friendly with Mia, so Vincent is nervous Before picking Mia up, he visits his drug dealer, Lance Eric Stoltz, and buys some high-quality heroin Properly sedated, he escorts the cocaine-addicted, chain-smoking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a West Hollywood 1950s-themed restaurant After some small talk about European travel, Mia's failed acting career, foot massage, and the rumors about Antoine which Mia dispels, Mia enters herself and Vincent in a dance contest They dance the twist and win an award After dinner, they return to the Wallaces' home Vincent goes to the bathroom to talk himself out of making a pass at Mia Meanwhile, she discovers the baggie of heroin in his coat pocket and, assuming it's cocaine, snorts some She immediately passes out and begins to foam at the mouth Panicked, Vincent takes the dying Mia to Lance's where they argue about what to do with her Following Lance's advice, Vincent is able to revive her with a shot of adrenaline administered straight to the heart Vincent takes Mia home They agree not to tell Marsellus what happened since both of them would get in trouble for itStory 2 The Gold WatchThe following night, before his fight, Butch dreams of an incident from his childhood Back at his Tennessee home in 1973, Captain Koons Christopher Walken visited Butch to bring him a gold watch The watch had belonged to Butch's great-grandfather, who took it to World War I with him Butch's grandfather had taken it to World War II, and Butch's father to Vietnam Butch's father died as a POW, but gave the watch to Koons to return to Butch Koons says that he and Butch's father had to hide the watch in their rectums to keep it away from their captorsButch wakes from the dream Instead of throwing the match not shown on-screen, he fights so viciously that he kills his opponent He took Marsellus' money and bet it on himself his winnings will amount to a small fortune Butch makes small talk with Esmarelda Angela Jones, the driver of the cab he is in, who reveals that she knows he's the boxer who killed his opponent she seems fascinated with the topic of death Esmarelda drives Butch to the seedy motel where he and his French girlfriend, Fabienne Maria de Medeiros, are staying"

tells his passengers in Spanish to be quiet It is a US Border Patrol ambush INS Agent Janus Fredric Lehne asks the driver, Nick the Slick Jon Gries where he's going and he replies, Fishin' in Cuernavaca They go to the back of the van to look at his catch Janus orders all the Hispanics in Spanish to get out and form a line He then asks Nick how much he got for each illegal alien, and then

telling him in Spanish that he'll break his face and that he's very ugly, but the man just nods and grunts in agreement Satisfied that the man doesn't speak any Spanish, Kay tells Dee that they have a

protective vinyl Kay instructs them to perform a splay burn of the region to cover up any evidence of extraterrestrials He then draws the INS agents' attention to a small device with a red strobe light he says that it's a neuralizer, a gift from some friends out of town, and that it will isolate memory impulses in their brains As the INS agents lean forward for a better look, Janus asks Kay who he really is, and he tells them that he's just a figment of their imagination Kay puts on his sunglasses and neuralizes the agents He removes his sunglasses, and then tells the INS agents that

recently died and left the family bankrupt, marries into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress S titai of the household Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly-lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen Ma Jingwu, the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shownSonglian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine he will spend the night with whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affectionsThe First Mistress, Yuru Jin Shuyuan, appears to be nearly as old as the master himself Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun Zhuyn, Cao Cuifen, befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan Mishn, He Caifei, a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpionSonglian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er Yn'r, played by Kong Lin who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraudZhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's pregnancy Doctor Gao Go-yshng, Cui Zhigang, who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a Mistress instead of a lowly servant it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the Master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bedYan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a robe that the master may wear and discard at his discretionAs Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen

Professor Abraham Van Helsing Anthony Hopkins Upon his arrival, Van Helsing immediately begins a blood transfusion on Lucy and places garlic near her bed When Lucy's suitors ask what could possibly have caused such extreme anemia, Van Helsing suggests that a supernatural force may have been stalking her The others find it too fantastical to believeMeanwhile, Mina has begun occupying herself with a dashingly dressed but mysterious man she met near the cinematograph He introduced himself as Prince Vlad of Szekely, and Mina is strangely drawn to him, as though she knows him He is easily able to

two minions' plan The two decide to tell Hades that they killed Hercules, but figure leaving him on Earth as a mortal will keep him from interfering in Hades' eventual plotAs Hercules is almost completely mortal, he cannot return to Mt Olympus However, the childless couple have taken him in, and raise him as their own However, not being completely mortal, Hercules is ostracized from the rest

to find answers Once inside the temple, the enormous statue of Zeus comes to life, first scaring Hercules, but then explaining how he is the young boy's father Zeus then explains that if Hercules can become a True Hero, he'll be able to return to My Olympus and rejoin them Zeus then provides Hercules with a winged horse named Pegasus, and sends them off to find PhiloctetesHercules and Pegasus find

grabs his assistants, realizing they have lied to him Pain and Panic manage to convince Hades that since Hercules is mortal, they can still kill himIn Thebes, Hercules tries to convince the citizens that he is a hero, but noone is willing to believe him Suddenly, Meg appears, and tells of two small boys trapped under a rock in a nearby canyon Hercules saves the little boys actually Pain and Panic in disguise, but then has to contend with the 3-headed beast called the Hydra After finding out that cutting off one head produces 3 more, Hercules ends up crushing the beast with a rock slide The

center of town where, with several police officers and officials present, he burns work permits that all non-Afrikaners are required to carry and present to police when demanded Gandhi's reasoning is that the permits are an unfair and oppressive symbol of Afrikaner rule over minorities As he burns them, he is struck by a police officer on the hand Though quite plainly in pain, Gandhi continues to burn the permits, his will overcoming the blows from the officer He is finally knocked down, unable to continue his protest and is arrestedWhen he's freed from jail, he meets a young American reporter, Walker, with whom he converses about the oppression of the masses by a handful of bureaucrats While they walk, Gandhi is confronted by an angry youth Daniel Day-Lewis in a bit part and his friends They demand that he pay them to walk down their street Gandhi refuses in the face of obvious bigotry When the young man's mother calls him inside, Gandhi and Walker continue down the streetGandhi travels to his home country of India When he arrives there he is met by members of the press who know of his exploits in South Africa They ask if he'll take up any political causes, especially those in opposition to the British rule of India Gandhi politely refuses the requests, saying he's only going to his home city of Porbandar His wife accompanies him Gandhi's real plan is to organize a non-violent protest against Britain, knowing that millions of Indians will follow him Very soon Gandhi realizes that the British rule of India is harsh and oppressive, having grown more so since he left to pursue his law degree and is growing worse each dayOne of Gandhi's first public protests is against the British textile industry He urges his followers to weave their own cloth for clothing and other needs and burn the British cloth they've been forced to buy and wear for decades However, many Indians, both Muslim and Hindu, stage more aggressive protests The crowds become angry mobs when they are attacked by the police Gandhi appears inwardly angry that his message has been misunderstoodIn Amritsar, a city in Northern India, a group of Indian citizens gather in the Jallianwala Bagh garden to protest an unfair town curfew Though the protest was peaceful, a British general, Reginald Dyer, orders his troops into the garden They take up firing positions in the courtyard When one of his lieutenants suggests that the protest is peaceful, Dyer says that the people have had their warning and commands his troops to open fire Many are killeda trial is held by the Hunter Commission, comprised of British and Indian officials Dyer himself testifies and is at first quite proud and defiant, claiming he wished to inflict a lesson that would be felt through all of the India When asked if he'd ordered his troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd, he says yes He also states he would have used the machine gun on the tank that accompanied his troops it was unable to fit through the narrow passage to the garden When an Indian attorney asks Dyer if he attempted to help the wounded in any way, he becomes agitated and says he would have A British official asks him how a wounded child that had been shot would be able to approach him for help Dyer is silentNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure After World War II, Britain finally grants Indian independence Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over The country is subsequently divided by religion It is decided that

robbery As they return to their hideout in Hole-in-the-Wall, they find out that the gang has selected a new leader, Harvey Logan He challenges Butch to a knife fight, which Butch wins, using a ruse Logan had the idea to rob the Union Pacific Flyer train instead of banks He wanted to rob it twice, the idea being that the return would be considered safe and therefore more money might be involved Butch takes this idea as his ownThe first robbery goes very well and the Marshal of the next town can't manage to raise a posse Butch and Sundance listen to his attempts, enjoying themselves Sundance's lover, Etta Place Katherine Ross, is introduced But obviously both men vie for her attention as she also goes bike-riding with Butch, a dialogue-free part of the film, accompanied by Raindrops Keep Falling on My HeadThe second robbery goes wrong Not only does Butch use too much dynamite to blow the safe, but also a second train arrives, which is carrying a posse of six heavily armed men on horseback that has been specially outfitted to hunt Butch and Sundance down The gang flees, but the entire posse follows Butch and Sundance They try hiding in a brothel in a nearby town that night, but are betrayed When they find out the posse is continuing to follow their trail, they try riding double on a single horse in the hope that the posse will split up, but that fails They then arrive in a nearby town and try to arrange an amnesty with the help of a friendly sheriff Jeff Corey of Carbon County But the sheriff tells them they have no chance of getting one, and that they will be hunted down until they are killed by the posseStill on the run the next day, they muse about the identities of their pursuers They fixate on Lord Baltimore, a famous Indian tracker, and Joe Lefors, a tough, renowned lawman, identifiable by his white skimmer hat which the lead posse member is wearing After climbing some mountains, they suddenly find themselves trapped on the edge of a canyon With their unseen persuers on their tail, they decide to jump into the river far below, even though Sundance can't swim and would prefer to fightLater that day, they arrive at Etta's house and learn from the local newspapers all about the posse and the identities of their persuers and that they have been paid to stay together until they kill Butch and the Kid They decide it's time to leave the country Destination BoliviaAfter a montage of showing Butch, Sundance, and Etta of their travels to New York, they arrive in a small Bolivian village at the end of the world Sundance already resents the choice Their first attempted bank robbery stops before it gets off the ground, as they are unable to speak or understand Spanish Etta teaches them the words they need Their next robbery is clumsily executed, as Butch still needs his cribsheet After each robbery, they seem to get better, until they are sought by the authorities all over BoliviaHowever, their confidence drops as one evening when Butch, Sundance, and Etta are having dinner at a fancy restaurant in a nearby town when they see a man wearing a white straw hat standing on the other side of the street talking to a few men Fearing that Lefors is once again after them, Butch suggests going straight, so as to not attract Lefors' attentionThey get their first honest job as payroll guards in a mine, directed by an American, named Garris Strother Martin However, on their first working day, they are attacked by highwaymen Garris is killed, and Butch and Sundance are forced to kill the Bolivian robbers Ironically, Butch had never killed a man in his entire criminal career, but while they are attempting to go straight, he is forced to kill the bandidos Since they seem unable to escape violence regardless of

motorcycle accident At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little successDuring the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge Over the objections of General Murray Donald Wolfit, he is sent by Mr Dryden Claude Rains of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal Alec Guinness in his revolt against the TurksOn the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali Omar Sharif for drinking from a well without permission Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton Anthony Quayle, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interestBrighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali Two teenage orphans, Daud John Dimech and Farraj Michel Ray, attach themselves to Lawrence as his servantsThey cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water Gasim I S Johar succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed

abu Tayi Anthony Quinn, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks Lawrence's plan is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud Since Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself Stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, he shoots him anyway The next morning, the intact alliance overruns the Turkish garrisonLawrence heads to Cairo to inform Dryden and the new commander, General Allenby Jack Hawkins, of his victory During the crossing of the Sinai Desert, Daud dies when he stumbles into quicksand Lawrence is promoted to major and given arms and money to support the Arabs He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the British have designs on Arabia Pressed, the general states they have no such

he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish Bey Jos Ferrer Lawrence is stripped, ogled and prodded For striking out at the Bey, he is severely flogged, then thrown out into the street Lawrence is so traumatised by the experience that he abandons all of his exploits, going from having proclaimed himself a god, to insisting he is merely a man He attempts to return to the British forces and swear off the desert, but he never fits in there In Jerusalem, Allenby urges him to support his big push on Damascus, but Lawrence is a changed, tormented man, unwilling to return

picked up on Earth The ship had disappeared without trace beyond the planet Neptune in 2040 her loss was considered the worst space disaster on record, with her entire 18-person crew missing and presumed dead The ship has suddenly reappeared in a decaying orbit around Neptune at the outer rim of the solar system, more than three billion kilometers from the nearest outpost on Saturn's moon Titan The Event Horizon's designer, Dr William Weir Sam Neill, who is staying on a space station orbiting Earth and is tormented by the memory of his dead wife, receives a call that he has to report to the station's dockThe rescue ship Lewis and Clark, commanded by Capt Miller Laurence Fishburne, is dispatched to investigate, with Dr Weir coming along Aboard the ship, there is very little time to socialize, as most team members were hastily pulled out of shore leave for this mission The crew is put into stasis due to the immense G-forces released during the flight to Neptune While in stasis, widower Dr Weir has a very lively nightmare of waking up and finding his late wife Claire Holley Chant on the ship's bridge with no eyes, which is interrupted when the Lewis and Clark arrives and he is awoken from stasis After getting ready, the crew is informed by Dr Weir that their mission is to salvage the Event Horizon He explains that the ship was actually built by the government to test a secret, experimental faster-than-light gravity drive The drive would create an artificial black hole to bridge two points in space to significantly reduce journey time The ship had been on its initial test flight, intended to reach Proxima Centauri it subsequently vanished without a trace, and a cover story of the ship being destroyed was given to the public Weir plays for the crew the only transmission received since the ship's reappearance, which is a series of garbled, confusing and intensely disturbing screams and shouts A human voice that was embedded in the transmission was filtered from the recording Medic DJ Jason Isaacs identifies it as a Latin phrase, liberate me save meUpon approaching the drifting vessel, XO Starck Joely Richardson tries to contact the ship, but there is no response After a short fly-over, the Lewis and Clark docks with the Horizon Sensors indicate the artificial gravity is off-line, as well as the climate system No definitive trace of human life is found these inconclusive sensor readings lead Captain Miller, Engineer Justin Jack Noseworthy and Medical Tech Peters Kathleen Quinlan to board the Horizon in space suits to search for survivors They enter via the ship's main corridor, which separates the two parts of the ship It is lined with explosives as an emergency measure in case of a catastrophe, the explosives will split the ship in two, separating the engine room with the gravity drive from the forward section, which is to be used as an escape vessel In the corridor, the team splits up Peters proceeds to the bridge, where she discovers a mutilated and frozen human corpse floating, with both eyes gouged out She successfully retrieves some of the on-board transmissions Justin enters the ship's gravity core It consists of an orb with rotating circles around it, with a pool of water below Upon entering, the lights suddenly turn on, and the orb seems to open, revealing a black, liquid-like mirror within it

Kazakhstan, and there was word that his stockpiling of nuclear weapons would have plunged the world into a second cold war His capture was made through the joint cooperation of President James Marshall Harrison Ford, and Russian President Petrov Alan WoolfSeveral weeks after the capture of Radek, President Marshall visits Moscow, along with his wife Grace Wendy Crewson and daughter Alice Liesel Matthews While Marshall is praised for his help in freeing Kazakhstan from Radek's grip, Marshall surprises everyone including his own men by deviating from his planned speech Marshall says that they were too slow to act, and vows to not allow such a thing happen againMarshall, his family, and his men are then returned to Air Force One, which takes off on its return trip to Washington DC Unknown to the President or anyone else, a rogue secret service agent named Gibbs Xander Berkeley has secretly allowed into the plane several men who are supporters of General Radek Gibbs kills several agents in a crucial protective position on the plane and the hijackers, led by Egor Korshunov Gary Oldman, don bulletproof vests and collect weaponry that is used by the Secret Service Korshunov and his men quickly gain control of the plane, killing several Secret Service officers and capturing the 1st Lady and the president's staff In the chaos, Marshall is ordered into an escape pod in the cargo holdAir Force One's pilots attempt an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Base, but are soon killed with one of Korshunov's men taking control of the plane A group of F-15's are sent after Air Force One as an escort The plane is piloted towards Kazakhstan, and Korshunov places a direct call to the White House, where Vice-President Kathryn Bennett Glenn Close and Defense Secretary Walter Dean Dean Stockwell listen to Korshunov's demands Korshunov requests the release of General Radek, with the stipulation that a hostage will be executed every half hour until his demands are met Shortly thereafter, the President's escape pod is found, but he is not inside During the firefight, Marshall hid aboard the plane, intent on saving his family, a fact which neither the White House or Korshunov are aware Korshunov assumes that the President escaped Air Force One, while the empty pod's discovery by the White House has them speculating that Korshunov and his men have killed MarshallBennett calls President Petrov, in hopes that he can release Radek temporarily with the hope that once Ivan has released the hostages, they can quickly recapture him However, Petrov is not willing to give into this request without proof that the President is alive After 30 minutes, Korshunov calls the White House to find out if Radek has been released When Bennett tries to stall for time, Korshunov coldly executes National Security Adviser Jack Doherty Tom Everett Korshunov then has Grace and Alice brought to the cockpit, leaving several men to guard the rest of the hostagesMarshall attempts to find his family, but almost is taken out by a henchman, before he kills him Marshall returns to the cargo hold where he manages to find a cellular phone, and places a call to the White House switchboard Marshall argues with the switchboard operator when she questions his claim to be The President, and he demands she trace the call As she realizes that Marshall is who he says he is, one of Korshunov's henchmen finds Marshall Marshall sticks the phone in his pocket At this point, the call is transferred through to the White House situation room, and Marshall gives indirect orders for one of the F-15's escorting the plane to fire on them Bennett relays the order, and the shockwave from the blast throws the henchman off-balance, allowing Marshall to kill him

Judas Breed, but Peter assures her they did the right thingOn a rainy night three years later, in a run-down church in a Lower Eastside neighborhood, a preacher Pak-Kwong Ho is attacked and flees to the roof of the building His assailant, a tall, thin man in a long overcoat, follows The preacher jumps onto a painter's scaffold rigged to the side of the building, to escape the ropes break and he falls to his death in the alley below After a few moments, his body is dragged roughly into a nearby storm drain A ten-year-old autistic boy, Chuy Alexander Goodwin, watches dispassionately from the apartment building across the alley where he lives with his father, Manny Giancarlo Giannini Chuy imitates the clicking sounds the attacker made with a pair of spoons Repeating funny, funny shoes to himself, he begins to bend a scrap of wire into a small figureNext morning Peter arrives at the church Police officers checking on the broken scaffold have discovered a large group of illegal immigrants locked up in the basement, all infected with yellow fever The CDC will need to set up a quarantine and investigate As Peter and his assistant Josh Josh Brolin look through the seedy old church, they come across a nasty surprise in a basement passageway Several large clumps of feces fastened to the ceiling, and hanging down from it, like stalactites Peter is concerned, since there is a connection between the basement passageways and the subway tunnels Josh collects a sample for analysis later, he shows Peter one of the bizarre components found in the sample buttonsregular

She offers them 10 for everything they accept it and leave Remy leaves shortly after, by the rear exit where her bike is parked She bumps into a tall, thin man in an overcoat, mumbles an apology and slips on past himSusan puts on a pair of surgical gloves and extracts the bug from the cornflakes box with a pair of forceps Large and unique, it nevertheless appears to be just a baby She reaches to examine it with her other handit bites her, latching ferociously onto the web of skin between her thumb and index finger Startled, she pulls it off roughly, jams it down onto a pin board, and stabs a large pin into it to hold it there She takes off the gloves and is checking for damage to her hand when she notices the bug is secreting a large amount of frothy liquidlike the Judas Breed She searches through her files on the creation of the Judas Breedshe finds a litmus test strip made from the secretionscompared side by side with a test strip from the new bug, they are identicalShe hears

unidentified man later revealed to be a Bosnian diplomat to the UN is murdered in an alley after receiving a page to meet someone outsideThe scene then immediately shifts to a missile base in Chelyabinsk, Russia, where SS-18 ICBM's are being decommissioned Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission A few minutes later the trains collide The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US governmentEven though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr Julia Kelly Kidman is not convinced SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately She believes that terrorists are behind the incident Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe Clooney, and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board A call to Devoe's long time friend and Russian counterpart, Dmitri Vertekoff Armin Mueller-Stahl, adds credence to his hypothesisKelly and Devoe try to track down the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia Devoe and Kelly go to the company's offices and, when Kelly is unable to get answers, Devoe resorts to more drastic measures, beating the man, tying him up and threatening to shoot him in the knee Kelly is able to retrieve vital invoices from the man's computer and the two leave the buildingWhen the Mafia realizes they are in fact US government agents, they send out several carloads of thugs to kill them Vertekoff is killed, but Kelly and Devoe escape, with Devoe killing most of the would-be assassins in the process Though the paper invoices Kelly retrieved are destroyed when Devoe ignites the gas tanks of his the thugs' car, Kelly is able to download them from her email When they're examined, Devoe recognizes Kodoroff's name Kodoroff is known to be fanatical and Devoe assumes that the rogue general will sell the warheads to a country linked to terrorismDevoe later finds out through the tracking system of the truck company that the nukes are in a truck headed to Iran by way of Dagestan Kodoroff and his crew are located using a ruse in which Devoe convinces the driver over the phone that there is a smart bomb falling towards him, causing him to turn out of traffic on a road, so that the truck can be seen in an aerial photo After the only Russian troops in the area are killed by the general and his men, one of the crew takes one of the warheads and leaps off the truck, hiding in the forest nearbyDevoe leads a group of USAF Special Operations and Army Rangers illegally over the Russian border to seize it During the operation, one of their choppers is shot down by Russian SAM battery when they enter Russian airspace, but the remaining choppers evade the missiles and are able to stop the truck carrying the warheads A savage fight ensues onboard the vehicle, and Kodoroff is killed and the warheads are seized Interrogation of the one surviving member of the group reveals that the trigger bomb nominal

Maurice Roves, having received notice to meet him there The garrison is commanded by Major Duncan Howard Steven Waddington who is betrothed to Cora Their route to Fort William Henry is led by a native guide named Magua Wes Studi who acts distant towards Duncan and expresses dissent towards the British in his native language, though Duncan is unaware that anything is amiss Magua then, without reason, turns and walks toward the back of the formation and the garrison is suddenly ambushed by a Huron war party The women are knocked off their horses and huddle in the undergrowth together as they watch helplessly as the British soldiers are overtaken At that moment, Chingachgook arrives with Uncas and Hawkeye and fight off the remaining Huron Magua himself takes aim at Cora but Hawkeye

escort them to Fort William Henry Uncas sends off the remaining horses, explaining that they're too loud and easy to track The party sets off on footEn route, Duncan questions Hawkeye and the reason he and his band were traveling west instead of fighting in the militia Hawkeye explains that he's no scout or militia man, implying that he takes no orders They soon all come to the Cameron's farm where Hawkeye discovers the inhabitants murdered and the cabin burned Hawkeye and Uncas note that nothing was stolen and they come to a conclusion that a war party was responsible and are most likely scouring the frontier for hapless colonials To Cora's astonishment, Hawkeye refuses to bury the dead but assures her that they are not merely strangers to him Later that night, as they camp, Hawkeye explains to a contrite Cora that if they had buried the Cameron's anyone looking for their trail would see it as a sign of their passing He speaks with her about how he was found by Chingachgook at a young age after his family was killed and raised as a Mohican and tells her a folktale about the creation of the stars, supposing that therein lies a monument to the Cameron's and his family He finds an understanding soul in Cora and keeps watch through the night A Huron hunting party comes close and they ready their defenses, but the party turns back since Hawkeye camped on burial grounds They are followed by the party through the next day as they near the fort When they arrive, they find it being bombarded by French cannon fireThey sneak into the fort where they are welcomed and the girls

maybe 31 or 41 -- and call in a tip a particular horse or horses to win, place, or show to the pay phone at the corner drugstore, where Lonnegan is waiting Gondorff's gang has also rented a room with a view of the corner drugstore when Lonnegan comes out on his way to the gambling den, a watcher rings a buzzer to warn them he's coming They run through this once with a fairly small bet to show Lonnegan the system will work the final plan they give Lonnegan calls for a bet so large it will ruin Gondorff They run into trouble when Lonnegan demands to meet Hooker's imaginary accomplice Hooker has told Lonnegan the key to the scam is his friend at Western Union who gives him race results by phone before they're released over the wire Pretending to be painters, the gang tricks a genuine Western Union manager into vacating his office for an hour, and one of them poses as the manager Lonnegan is convincedMeanwhile, Lonnegan's goons have tracked Hooker to Chicago but failed to kill him They -- and Lonnegan -- have no idea that the man Lonnegan is helping to con Gondorff is the same guy who helped Luther take the runner's money at the beginning of the movie Lonnegan assigns the job to someone called Solino, who, it's implied, is a very skilled assassinLt Snyder Charles Durning, a Joliet cop, has pursued Hooker to the big city because Hooker gave Snyder counterfeit cash when Snyder tried to shake him down Snyder isn't getting very far when Hooker can't stay out of Snyder's way entirely, he can outrun him Snyder is induced to assist FBI Agent Polk Dana Elcar, who's after

FBI will let the Lonnegan con run its course before arresting GondorffThe night before the final act of the con, Hooker hooks up with Loretta Dimitra Arliss, the new waitress at the diner where he likes to eat When he wakes up, she's gone He's somewhat puzzled to find that she hasn't robbed him He dresses, fits something we don't get a good look at over his back teeth, and goes out A man whom

along on the matter Peter tells Howard that if he still wants to get married to a woman Peter will not stop him, but he also tells Howard that he is hiding the true fact of who he isHoward's final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help audio cassette, although that fails as well During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he instead says, I'm gay The wedding is off, and although Peter is proud of Howard, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily Things take a turn for the worse when he is

out that it is near the end of 1941, and the German Atlantic U-Boat fleet is a mere 12 subsNow cut to the officers of U-96 driving down a dark road by the shore Enlisted sailors are drunk and hanging out on the road They harass the officers in a fairly obnoxious way, including urinating on their car as it goes by The officers including, as you soon find out, the Captain take this in strideThe next scene is in a raucous beer hall It is an award banquet for a sub captain Thomsen Otto Sander, who just received a commendation, as well as a sending off for U-96's crew Various scenes of debauchery play out The officers are just a bunch of rowdy kids having fun U-96's Captain Jrgen Prochnow looks on calmly The Captain is then introduced to a party reporter, Lt Werner Herbert Grnemeyer who will be accompanying them on their next tour to report on the greatness of the Reich's sub crews They meet the Captain's chief engineer and de facto second-in-command The Chief, Klaus Wennemann, who is older and bedraggled and obviously doesn't look forward to another tourThe Captain goes to find Thomsen as it is time for the old guy to give a speech He finds Thomsen nearly passed out drunk in a disgusting bathroom He manages to get Thomsen to his feet with the help of another officer and guides him to the podium They note sadly that all the crews these days are just kids, and that the old guard is almost gone Thomsen gives a speech full of what comes very close to anti-Nazi rhetoric a couple guys in the audience, possibly SS men, look tense, but ends it on a positive note without saying anything too incriminatingNow U-96 leaves port and you meet the rest of the crew Of most note are the first lieutenant Hubertus Bengsch, a prissy young hardcore Nazi, and the second lieutenant Martin Semmelrogge who is a clever jokester and constantly winds up the first lieutenant Lt Werner, the reporter, is led to the junior officer's bunks where he finds out that even the officers have to share beds because of space constraints Lt Werner is ribbed by Pilgrim Jan Fedder, another jokester, and befriends a very young officer, Ullmann, with a French girlfriend back home who he constantly writes letters to You also get your first shot of Johann, the head of the engine room, a pale, gangly fellow whom the crew members call The GhostNow is the first stretch of drudgery in the movie Lt Werner snaps pictures of everything in sight initially, but gradually calms down The crew goes about their day to day business with increasing dreariness, all of them except the first lieutenant stop shaving and grow beards, and their moil is only broken by a false alarm arranged by the Captain to keep them on their toes During this time you learn that the Captain has no love for the Nazis, and morale amongst the higher officers seems abysmalThe Captain at one point decides to see how deep the sub can dive The gauge limits the safe zone down to only 170 meters, but the Captain, much to the chagrin of the crew, takes it down to almost 200 This causes ominous creaking noises to emit from the hull, and everyone is relieved when the Captain orders the sub back upAfter more boredom, the sub receives a transmission that a convoy has been spotted The crew leaps at the opportunity to go after them, but the Captain says they have no chance of getting there in time and so they go back to twiddling their thumbsShortly thereafter, they get a message about a convoy that they will be able to intercept, and the Captain kicks the sub into full gear to catch it They approach the convoy in very heavy fog, but before they can even get close enough to see anything one of the escort destroyers spots them and the sub has to dive After being depth charged repeatedly by the destroyer but taking no real damage, the Captain manages to lose them and escape The Captain notes that the Br"

Slaughtered Lamb, where they're coldly greeted by the locals One of the regulars tells an off-color joke and while everyone, including David and Jack, laughs, Jack asks why the bar has a sort of shrine with candles and a pentacle The bar is immediately silenced and the locals become even more unfriendly, prompting David and Jack to leave Before they leave, the locals tell them to stay on the road outside and not to wander into the moorsAs Jack and David walk along the road it begins to rain and the fog surrounding them grows thicker Subsequently, they drift off the road and find themselves disoriented on the moors They hear the ominous baying of an animal in the distance and Jack suggests they return to the village They then hear a low growling nearby and catch sight of a large animal, which is circling them They hurry off in the opposite direction, only to find that the creature has flanked them Hurrying faster, they break into a run and David trips and falls While they laugh over David's accident and Jack helps him up, Jack is attacked by a large wolf, which savagely mutilates him David had run off but runs back when he hears Jack screaming He finds Jack's body ripped apart and is himself attacked by the wolf, which bites and scratches him on his face and shoulder Gunshots are heard the villagers from the Slaughtered Lamb have appeared and have shot the wolf Before he falls unconscious, David sees the bloodied body of a naked man lying next to himDavid wakes up in a London hospital His doctors and nurses inform him that he's been unconscious for three weeks since the attack and that Jack is dead The police have also informed his parents about his condition David is distraught at the thought of Jack's murder and the doctors sedate him Later, he's visited by a chief of police and a representative from the American Consulate The question him about the incident where Jack was killed David doesn't have much to tell them except that Jack was killed by a large and powerful animalThe policeman tells David that he'd talked to the patrons of the Slaughtered Lamb and they'd told him that Jack was killed by a recently escaped murdererDavid begins to experience strange dreams that become nightmares in one, he runs nude through the forest and comes to a bed He sees himself lying in the bed when the bedridden David opens his eyes, they appear animal-like and he snarls After a few days in the hospital, David sees an apparition of Jack, still mutilated Jack has come back as a spirit to warn David that they were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf Worse, David will be doomed to transform into a werewolf himself at the next full moon, a few days from then Jack also tells David that he must kill himself to break the werewolf's bloodline, or he may attack others and continue the cycle Jack is incredulous, thinking that his trauma from the experience is affecting his mind Jack assures him that the curse is very realOne of David's nurses, Alex, becomes very attracted to David and invites him to stay with her at her London flat after he's released The two become lovers Late one night while Alex is asleep, David wakes up to use the bathroom He is startled by Jack, whose spirit form has begun to decay David is still unwilling to believe Jack's warning, even when Jack tells him that he may harm Alex Jack disappears and David is left still believing he's losing his mindDavid is left alone in Alex' apartment when she goes to work That night, David suddenly begins to scream in pain and he slowly transforms into a wolf Loose

as long as he takes extreme measures to leave no traces of his identity as an in-valid But, where he was once an object of scorn and pity, he is now a perpetrator of an unspeakable fraud Legally, exposure would only subject him to fines, but socially the consequences would be far more extreme - he is now a heretic against the new order of genetic determinism Vincent is now a borrowed ladder a reference to the ladder structure of an un-coiled DNA strand or in harsher language, a de-gene-erateWith Jerome's impressive genetic profile he easily gains access to the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation his interview consists entirely of a urine test, the most prestigious space-flight conglomerate of the day With his own equally impressive determination, he quickly becomes the company's ace celestial navigator But a week before Vincent is scheduled to leave for Saturn's moon Titan, the mission director is murdered, and evidence of Vincent's own in-valid DNA is found in the building in the form of an eyelash The presence of this unexpected DNA attracts the attention of the police, and Vincent must evade ever-increasing security as his mission launch date approaches and he pursues a relationship with his co-worker Irene Cassini Uma ThurmanAfter numerous close calls, the investigation eventually comes to a close as Director Josef Adam S Gottbetter is arrested for the murder by the lead detective covering the investigation Alan Arkin The Director reveals that he murdered the mission director in order to buy time for the mission to launch, because the window of opportunity for the launch is only open once every seventy years, and that it is now too late to stop the launch However, just as Vincent appears to be in the clear, he is confronted by one of the detectives, who is revealed as Vincent's estranged brother, Anton Loren Dean Anton tries to convince Vincent to go with him for protection before Vincent is found out However, it soon becomes apparent that Anton is acting more out of insecurity and is more concerned with how Vincent had managed to get the better of him, despite his supposed genetic superiority Vincent and Anton settle their competition as they did when they were children, by seeing who could swim out into the ocean farthest As he did once before when they were young, Vincent manages to beat his brother, and, once again, saves him from drowning This is simply because he refused to save any strength to swim back - he is willing to risk everything to succeed Conversely his brother worried about preserving enough strength to swim out and return again, and these fears kept him"

book artists and lifelong friends Holden is the calmer, more reasonable of the duo Banky, meanwhile, is the caustic and short-tempered half The story opens at a comic book convention in New York City where the two are promoting their latest comic series 'Bluntman and Chronic' During a panel discussion, they meet Alyssa Jones Joey Lauren Adams She is a struggling comic book writer whom is friends with the African-American comic book writer and activist Hooper Dwight Ewell who puts on this militant image to hide his flamboyantly gay personalityThat evening, the four go out for drinks together at a local bar where Holden is attracted to Alyssa based on their conversation during a dart game Through Hooper she invites Holden to a get together at a bar she frequents Banks comes along and while there Alyssa is asked to sing a song During the song Banky notices that they are in a female gay bar and that Alyssa is singing the love song to a woman in the audience and not to Holden who thinks the song is for him The four of them end up at a booth and Alyssa and Banky have an involved conversation about sex with women and Holden is visibly upset about Alyssa being a lesbian However, they have discovered they are both from the same area of New Jersey and the two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops During their discussions it is clear that Holden has a very narrow heterosexual view on male female relationships and sex in general The new friendship does not sit well with the homophobic Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by the relationship that develops between her and Holden Holden and Banky's business relationship suffers as well -- the two had been on the verge of signing a lucrative deal to turn Bluntman and Chronic into television show and Banky feels that Holden is no longer taking their combined efforts or the TV show seriouslyEventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa She is initially angry with him and walks awayHolden follows her and they have a heated discussion about their relationship and she walks away again Holden is confused and while returning to his vehicle Alyssa runs up, they embrace and that night the two begin a romantic relationship Banky walks in the next morning and finds them together sleeping on his couch in the studio This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky who distrusts Alyssa and that his friend is going to be hurt when the relationship fails Banky runs across an old friend who grew up with Alyssa who tells him a sexual adventure story from Alyssa's past Banky reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which earned her the nickname Finger Cuffs for getting it from both ends Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed based on their conversations about love and sex that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept withHolden asks advice from Hooper who tells him that if he wants his relationship with Alyssa to work, he must be honest and truthful as to put whatever is bothering him behind him by being up front with her about it and then put it behind him Hooper also tells Holden he believes the issues with Banky is that Banky is jealous and in love with him and that his macho sexual banter is a disguise for his true feelingsThe following evening, Holden confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game and he clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing in the stands During a tearful argument in the parking lot, she tells Holden about her youthful sexual experimentations involving men She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with but justified it by saying she could see that he took pleasure in the thought However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confusedLater, during lunch at a local diner with the"

crawl reveals that after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebels were forced to evacuate their base on the Yavin moon and the dreaded Imperial Fleet of the Galactic Empire has pursued the Rebel Alliance across the galaxy, forcing them to establish a secret base on the remote ice planet Hoth Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader David Prowsevoice James Earl Jones sends robotic probes in search of the base and its commander and hero, Luke Skywalker Mark HamillWhile Luke is patrolling near the base, he sees what looks like a meteor hitting the ground near his location Before he can ride his mount to the site, he's knocked unconscious by an indigenous, polar bear-like predator, the wampa Back at the base, the smuggler-pilot Han Solo Harrison Ford announces his intention to leave the Rebels and pay the debt he owes to the gangster Jabba the Hutt, much to the displeasure of Princess Leia Carrie Fisher After Han discovers that Luke has not returned from patrol, he delays his departure and leaves the base to search for him on an ostrich-like creature called a tauntaunMeanwhile, Luke escapes the wampa's lair, using the Force to retrieve his nearby lightsaber and wounding the beast, but is overcome by the cold outside He sees an apparition of his late mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi Alec Guinness, who instructs him to receive training from Jedi Master Yoda voice Frank Oz on the planet Dagobah Han finds Luke and gives him shelter, using his own tauntaun's carcass to keep Luke warm, until he can build a sturdier shelter The two are rescued the following morning by a Rebel patrol Luke is taken to the medical bay to heal from the wounds he received from the wampa In his recovery room he's met by Leia, Han and Chewbacca Peter Mayhew Han jovially reminds Luke that he's rescued him twice from certain dangerSometime later, when ground scans detect an object outside the base perimeter at Zone 12, Han and Chewie, investigate, and find an Imperial probe droid that transmits the location of the Rebel base to the Imperial fleet before firing upon Chewie and destroying itself On the bridge of Darth Vader's massive flagship, the droid's transmission is picked up by Captain Piett, but his superior, the fleet Admiral Ozzel, dismisses the message until Vader sees the transmission and realizes it is the Rebel base He overrules Ozzel and orders the Imperial Fleet to the Hoth systemLater, as the Fleet emerges from hyperspace, Vader is informed by his infantry commander, General Veers, that the Rebels have set up infantry trenches and an energy shield to protect them from the Empire's orbital bombardment Ordering Veers to launch a surface attack, Vader is furious that Ozzel has clumsily given away the element of surprise by bringing his ship out of light speed too close to the planet, and he communicates this displeasure to Captain Piett as he promotes him on the spot to admiral while Ozzel is given Vader's own fatal brand of reprimandOn the surface, the Imperial forces land their ground assault troops, a unit of over a dozen four-legged AT-AT walkers along with a few dozen two-legged AT-ST walkers beyond the energy shield and Luke leads his squadron of flying speeders into battle Realizing that their blasters cannot damage the heavily armored walkers, Luke devises an attack plan that has his squad using their towing cables to bind the legs of the walkers to trip them, making them more vulnerable A few walkers are destroyed but the Imperial forces eventually overpower the Rebels and destroy the generator powering the energy shield, capturing the Rebel base Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and their droid C-3PO Anthony Daniels flee on board the Millennium Falcon Luke makes it back to the base after personally

Florida, her longest communication yet at over a thousand miles from her home near Madison, Wisconsin That night Ellie asks if she could ever have a transmitter powerful enough to talk to her deceased mother who died in childbirth Her father says he doesn't know but suggests that Ellie is tenacious enough that she probably could accomplish such a task one dayEllie's father dies one night while they

work, to which Drumlin chastises her for spending time on 'nonsense'Taking action, Ellie and her team pool together to try and get funding for their project from private sources Ellie and her team spend 18 months searching, before finding their benefactor in the form of S R Hadden John Hurt, a billionaire investor who had been known for innovation and had fallen out of favor in the scientific community While giving a presentation to the Hadden Industries board of directors, Ellie becomes confrontational when it seems the board has no interest in funding her project One of the board members receives an unexpected phone call and tells Ellie that she has her funding Ellie looks at a nearby observation camera and mouths Thank youHadden's funding allows Ellie to have access to the 'Very Large Array' VLA in New Mexico, a facility with 27 large radio antenna dishes which Ellie uses to continue her search Even here, Drumlin and the scientific community are not far behind With 4 years of finding nothing, and even though all funding for the project is privatized by Hadden Industries, and because of Ellie's relentless pursuit and reputation for bizarre experiments, the project is still in danger of being shut down by Drumlin again Even so, Ellie vows not to quitOne evening, while listening intently, Ellie hears a powerful signal a prime number pattern emanating from the star Vega,

clad only in pajamas and a bathrobe, tumbles off the train and down an embankmentThe scene shifts to Mgve, the premier ski resort in the French Alps, where Regina Lampert Audrey Hepburn is sitting at a table on a platform overlooking the mountain Before her is food sufficient for three adults, not just one She is totally oblivious as an automatic pistol, held by a gloved hand, takes direct aim at her The hand pulls the trigger--and out shoots a harmless water jet that sprays all over her face Taking off her glasses, Regina looks at young Jean-Louis Gaudet Thomas Chelimsky, age 8, who suddenly looks very guilty Don't tell me, says Reggie, you didn't know it was loadedShe calls out for her friend, Sylvie Gaudet Dominique Minot, who sends the boy to find some other place to play while she helps Reggie to dry off Noting the table full of food, Sylvie asks Reggie what's wrong The answer Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, Charles The two stroll through the resort as Reggie says that she is frustrated with Charles' incessant secrecy and lies Sylvie, a modern woman to the core, suggests that Reggie simply have affairs on her husband's money, but Reggie doesn't think that wayJust then a dapper gentleman Cary Grant approaches, with Jean-Louis in tow, saying that Jean-Louis was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild As Sylvie takes Jean-Louis back to apologize to the Rothschilds, the mystery man, giving his name out as Peter Joshua, strikes up a conversation with Reggie Reggie flirts with him almost outrageously, and Peter Joshua plays along The two agree to reconnect when they each return to ParisReggie arrives home--only to discover that her apartment is totally empty, and even the maid is gone--along with every stitch of clothing, every piece of furniture, and even the rugs After she opens cabinet after cabinet, finding them all empty, she starts to rush out--and runs pell-mell into Inspector Edouard Grandpierre Jacques Marin of the Police Judiciare Grandpierre asks her to come with him to the Prefecture--and specifically to the Paris Morgue There Reggie identifies a dead man in fact it's the man who fell off the Paris-Bordeaux train in his PJs as her husbandGrandpierre continues the interview in his office He tells her that the authorities found Charles' body near the railroad tracks, and that he had a steamship ticket to Venezuela on him when he died The authorities also know that, two days ago, Charles had sold everything in the apartment at public auction Value 1,250,000 NF, or 250,000 US The problem the authorities in Bordeaux did not find the money Grandpierre gives back to Reggie all the items that Charles had on him one wallet containing 4,000 francs, one pocket appointment book listing his last appointment for the day before, 500 pm, Jardin des Champs-lyses, one steamship ticket, one letter stamped but not sealed, addressed to Reggie contents unremarkable, one key to the apartment, one pocket comb, one toothbrush, one tin of tooth powder--and, more incredibly still, four passports, one each Swiss, American, Italian, and Chilean, each under a different name Of these, Reggie recognizes only the Swiss passportReggie goes home, for what it's worth, and stands in the dark, smoking a cigarette, when Peter Joshua arrives He says only that he read about Charles Lampert's death in the newspapers and came to be of help Eventually Peter offers to take Reggie to a modest hotel near enough to her job at the European Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, where she and Sylvie work as

to the shock of her family when they find her after hearing her scream loudlyThe film then cuts to Ian Malcolm, who is called to the Mansion of John Hammond, the former head of InGen Malcolm meets Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim there, whom he encountered on Isla Nublar in the first film Malcolm also meets Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who has taken over InGen as its new Chief Executive Officer Both trade barbs over the aftermath of the incidents at Jurassic Park, with Malcolm chastising Ludlow for covering up what really happened, and Ludlow claiming Malcolm went public telling stories of which Malcolm counters he told the truth but took no payment for what he revealedMalcolm then is allowed to visit Hammond, who is now bed-ridden Malcolm is soon shocked when Hammond tells him about Site B Isla Nublar was the location for Jurassic Park, but Site B was where the animals were originally created and bred However, in the aftermath of Hurricane Clarissa, Site B was evacuated and the animals let loose to roam free, with them inhabiting an environment free of human interference This shocks Malcolm as he had assumed that the dinosaurs should have died, since they were bred with a lysine deficiency, that needed to be supplied by medical means Hammond explains he has no idea why they are still alive, and shocks Malcolm when he explains that a research team has been recruited to conduct studies on this subject, and that brings him to Malcolm, who Hammond wants to be the 4th member of the teamHammond then explains that after the incidents at Jurassic Park, InGen has been on the verge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for some time, with the Board wanting to exploit the remaining dinosaurs on Site B for profit purposes Hammond was able to keep them from doing so until

nephew Peter has plannedMalcolm of course refuses Hammond's offer, and plans to make sure that the research team does not set foot on the island However, he soon finds that his former girlfriend Sarah Harding Julianne Moore has already arrived, with the additional members to meet her in 3 days Malcolm then leaves planning to rescue Sarah from Site BMalcolm's next stop is a garage owned by Eddie

Enterprise-E, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan aggression, as Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels The Enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the USS Defiant and its captain, the Klingon Worf Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship1 The

and walks over to Pollux, and converses as Leo and Lars change his coat and sunglasses Pollux is annoyed that Castor is running 26 minutes behind schedule Castor lights a cigarette and asks Pollux if he hasn't deviated from their plans Pollux admits that he paid for the jet himself to save them time Castor reminds him that that is for the boys to handle so they can hide their movements, but he's not going to kill Pollux for such a screw-up because he loves him too much to do such a thing He then bends over and quickly ties Pollux's shoelaces Castor then tempts Leo and Lars with a gold money

film opens to the sounds of a couple having sex Afterwards, Carlos the Jackal Aidan Quinn kills a spider in its web with his cigarette and evicts the womanLucie Laurier from his room because he claims he has work to do He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA agent Jack Shaw Donald Sutherland is sitting at a table outdoors He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light Shaw does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise, but he turns to watch Carlos enter the cafe He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of peopleThe film shows an event of attacking the OPEC meeting by the Jackal and his fellows in 1975In the present day, Carlos is apprehended in an open air market and brutally interrogated by a Mossad commander named Amos Ben Kingsley Carlos claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Shaw who tries to recruit him to play Carlos' double Ramirez is so embittered by his rough treatment in Amos' hands, that he insists he will sue and flatly rejects the idea of portraying Carlos Shaw persists, wooing Ramirez on several occasions He finally convinces Ramirez by showing him a child in a hospital who he claims is a victim of one of Carlos' bombingsAmos and Shaw train Ramirez at a remote location Much of his training is devoted to situational awareness and internalizing details of Carlos' life His training concludes with one of Carlos' ex-mistresses training Ramirez in how to make love like Carlos The plan to catch Carlos revolves around convincing the KGB, which supports much of his terrorism, that he has begun to work with the CIA The team lures one of Carlos' girlfriends to Libya, where Ramirez meets up with her, successfully posing as Carlos, even during their lovemaking The girlfriend has become an informant for the French, however Several French agents arrive at their apartment, and Ramirez is forced to kill them to survive He is horrified at having to kill allies in his undercover operationCarlos sends an assassin to kill the girlfriend in France, ordering him to leave Europe through London The assassin happens to be in Heathrow airport at the same time as Ramirez, and he quickly realizes he is an impostor after Ramirez doesn't recognize him The assassin forces Ramirez into a bathroom and a struggle ensues Amos rushes in and manages to kill the assassin before being fatally shot After Amos' death, the CIA shuts down the mission and Ramirez returns homeBack with his wife, he makes love to her as Carlos would, and she is disturbed by the change in his personality The next day, at his son's little league game, he gets into a confrontation with another father and nearly kills him Shaw bails him out of jail, and both men are clearly suffering deeply by not being able to finish their mission and kill CarlosThey head to East Berlin and conspicuously meet with each other The KGB sees Ramirez meeting with Shaw and assumes Carlos has turned on them They raid his hotel, but as they try to arrest them, he escapes Shaw and Ramirez are waiting outside the hotel for him, and Ramirez fights Carlos on the bank of a river It's impossible to tell which is the real Carlos during the struggle As one of the men is being held under water by the other, Shaw comes upon them and shoots the man above the water several times He realizes that he has shot Ramirez, and Carlos swims away Ramirez presses Shaw to leave him and chase Carlos, but Shaw insists that their plan has worked and Carlos is a marked man by the KGB One way or another, Shaw points out that Carlos' days as a terrorist are overThe deaths of Ramirez and his family are staged by Shaw, and in the final scene, the family are safely cavorting on a beach Ramirez moves to kill a spider in its web with his cigarette, but appears to change his

to make the Fleet her career dashes Johnny's dreams as well as the future of his romance with her Following a training incident in which one of his squad members is killed, Johnny is demoted from squad leader and publicly flogged in accordance with military law As Johnny is telling his parents via videophone that he is quitting the Infantry the transmission is interrupted The 'Bugs' have directed an asteroid at Earth, destroying Buenos Aires, killing his parents and most of the population of that city As a result of this sneak attack, Earth declares war on the 'Bugs' and Johnny stays with the InfantryThe Federation's forces mount a large-scale invasion of Klendathu, which becomes an unmitigated disaster due to underestimation of their foes combat abilities 'Bug plasma' energy discharges from the surface by huge 'Tanker Bugs' thought to be flame-spewing battle tanks on the surface now turn out to be giant artillery pieces capable of surface-to-space barrages creating massive damage to the Fleet in spaceWith much of the Fleet in space destroyed or badly damaged, the Mobile Infantry on the surface now cut off from air support is overcome by swarms of thousands of 'Bug' warriors Over 100,000 troops are killed before a retreat can be performed and several of Johnny's fellow recruits are killed, Johnny himself being severely woundedLater at the Ticonderoga Battle Station, where the remains of the Fleet dock, Carmen looks up Johnny Rico's name on a computer screen, it shows 308,563 casualties from the one-day battle, most of them being KIA or MIA Johnny's squad is almost wiped out and Carmen, due to an error in the casualty list, believes he is deadFederation scientists are baffled by the Bugs' use of military tactics and postulate that there must be a caste of 'Brain Bugs' that serve as generals for the ArachnidsAfter a few days' rest, Johnny, Dizzy, and fellow squad member Ace Levy Jake Busey are re-assigned to the 'Roughnecks', a special unit of Mobile Infantry which is led by Johnny's old high-school teacher, Lieutenant Jean Rasczak Michael Ironside, a veteran of the First Bug War several years earlier who has been brought out of retirement to lead the group Back on Earth, a new Sky Marshal revises the campaign, using strikes on other planets in the Klendathu system to learn more about the Arachnids' tactics After aerial napalm strikes against the planets, Lt Rasczak's squad lands on Planet 'P' to mop up Johnny's leadership and his skill in combat while destroying a"

fired from her public relations job The plot splits into two parallel universes, based on the two paths her life could take depending on whether she catches a London Underground train or notIn the timeline in which she makes the train, she meets James John Hannah on the underground and they strike up a conversation She gets home in time to catch her boyfriend Gerry John Lynch in bed with his American ex-girlfriend Lydia Jeanne Tripplehorn she dumps him and moves in with her friend Anna Zara Turner James continues to serendipitously pop into Helen's life, cheering her up and encouraging her to start her own public relations firm Helen gets a new makeover by cutting her hair short and dying it blond She and James fall in love despite Helen's reservations about beginning another relationship so soon after her ugly breakup with GerryIn the timeline in which she misses the train, she then hails a taxi instead but gets mugged when a man snatches her handbag Helen hits her head in the scuffle and goes to hospital She arrives home late, giving Lydia time to leave Helen carries on with her life oblivious of Gerry's infidelity, and begins working part-time jobs to pay bills Gerry conceals his infidelity and juggles the two women in his life Lydia even interacts with Helen on several occasions Helen has a number of conflicts with Gerry, then discovers she's pregnant with his baby, but delays telling himIn the first timeline, Helen discovers she's pregnant, believing it is with James' child, and goes to see him at his office She is stunned to learn from James' secretary that he is married Upset, she disappears James finds her on a bridge and explains that he was married but is now separated and planning to divorce He and his soon-to-be ex-wife maintain a cordial relationship for the sake of his sick mother After she and James declare their love for another, Helen walks out into the road and is hit by a carIn the second timeline, Helen tells Gerry she has a job interview with an international PR firm Thinking Helen is at the interview, Gerry sees Lydia, who is also pregnant with his child While there, the doorbell rings and Lydia tells Gerry to answer it Helen is there, and is stunned when Lydia tells her she can't do the interview because she's deciding whether or not to keep your boyfriend's baby Distraught over finally catching her two-timing boyfriend's infidelity, Helen runs and falls down Lydia's staircaseIn both timelines, after her accident hit by a car in the first timeline, and falling down the stairs in the second Helen goes to hospital and happens to end up in the very same emergency room in both timelines, and loses her baby In the timeline in which she caught the train, she dies from internal bleeding in the arms of her newfound love In the timeline in which she didn't, she recovers and tells Gerry to leave for good Before waking up, she sees flashes of the other Helen's lifeIn the final scene now taking place solely in the missed the train universe, James is leaving the hospital after visiting his mother, and Helen is leaving after ending her relationship with Gerry Helen drops an earring in the elevator and it is picked up by James This mirrors the start of the film, where James picks up Helen's earring on the elevator after Helen is fired from her job Before the doors close, James tells Helen to cheer up, and repeats his line, You know what the Monty Python boys say Helen who, in the beginning of the film, assumed the rejoinder to be always look on the bright side of life says, Nobody expects

by the gallery's board of directors to fire Bean are thwarted by the chairman who, for unspecified reasons, is very fond of him Desperate to rid themselves of the turmoil Bean unintentionally causes, the board members send him to the United States to represent them at the unveiling of the portrait Whistler's Mother, which has been purchased for 50 million by the Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles Bean's visit has been arranged by the gallery's curator, David Langley Peter MacNicol who is being very impressed by the National Gallery's fabricated praise of Dr Bean, decides to board him in his house On his flight to Los Angeles, Bean attempts to amuse a child with air sickness by blowing up his MMs bag and popping it to wake up the man in front of him, but without success After the child throws up into an air sickness bag, Bean takes the bag from him and repeats the bag popping over the man's face, only to splatter him with vomit He hides from the man upon his arrival to Los Angeles, where he is detained at the airport due to pretending to have a gun His arrival at David's house is initially met with subtle hostility from David's wife Alison Pamela Reed, son Kevin Andrew Lawrence, and daughter Jennifer Tricia Vessey Alison refuses David's request to allow Bean to live with them for two months, and David promises Alison that he will talk to Bean and take him to a hotel after their meeting at the galleryBean's unorthodox arrival at the gallery worries many of David's colleagues, particularly his boss, George Grierson Harris Yulin, who subtly warns David that he will be responsible for Bean's actions at the unveiling of the painting, but David promises that he can handle Bean, convinced that he is merely a little eccentric When David takes Bean back to his house, Alison departs for her mother's home, unwilling to live with Bean With his family gone, David decides to take Bean on a tour of the Los Angeles art galleries However, Bean decides that he and David should go to Pacific Park instead, but lands in police detainment for the second time after accidentally tampering with the controls of a motion simulator ride, making it go dangerously fast after deeming that his first ride earlier was too slow This prompts Lieutenant Brutus Richard Gant, who dealt with Bean at the airport, to make David accountable for Bean, threatening to arrest Bean if he ever steps out of line againFollowing a miserable dinner with Grierson which David had forgotten about, where Bean accidentally blows up the microwave after attempting to cook their Thanksgiving turkey in it, David finally realises that Bean is not a doctor and knows nothing about art He is obliged to continue with the deception, however, as he has already staked his professional career on Bean's supposed reputation as a noted art scholar The next day, Whistler's Mother arrives at the Grierson Art Gallery, and Bean is given a few minutes alone to study it, in an effort to keep him out of trouble While dusting the frame, Bean accidentally sneezes on the painting and wipes it with a handkerchief, not knowing that it is covered in blue ink from a broken pen, and therefore the painting is stained Terrified, Bean takes it to the caretaker's cupboard to get some agent by which to remove the ink He uses lacquer thinner, which also dissolves the painted face from the painting Much to his horror, Bean attempts to patch it up with an extremely unconvincing cartoon face Upon seeing it, David is also horrified and hides the painting behind its metal security shutters Fearing that David will lose his job and possibly face criminal proceedings for his vandalism, he and Bean head off to a bar to drown their sorrowsDuring the night, Bean hatches his plan to restore Whistler's

insurance salesman leading an idyllic, peaceful life on Seahaven IslandTruman also happens to be the star of the most popular live show in television history The only problem is, he doesn't know it In fact, the entire island of Seahaven is a complete fabrication a massive set surrounded by a protective dome that produces the most sophisticated effects and imagery to mimic the sky, weather, and temperature of the real world Set just off of what appears to be the coast of Florida, the dome is run by a massive staff hidden just beyond its barriers and managed by the artistically eccentric Director, Christof Ed Harris Christof has filmed Truman since just before his birth and sees the project as a ray of hope a way to truthfully portray a person's life nonstop while maintaining their innocenceIt is on Day 10,909 of Truman's life that things begin to change As he's getting ready for work, he greets his neighbors across the street Fritz Dominique, Angel Schmiedt, and Nastassja Schmiedt, with his traditional greeting of, Good morning And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night, before a mysterious object falls from the sky and lands near his car When Truman looks up, however, the sky is clear and offers no explanation for the object, which we can see is obviously a studio light As he drives to work, the radio reports that an aircraft flying over the island shed parts which leads Truman to believe that was the source of the fallen object At work, Truman discreetly tears pieces of paper out of a magazine and stows them away before making a call asking for directory information to Fiji He asks for a Lauren or Silvia Garland When neither of the names bears results he hangs up just as his boss, Lawrence Peter Krause, approaches and asks him to close a deal on Harbor Island Reluctantly, Truman leaves but once he reaches the pier he is forced to return to work due to his fear of open waterAt home Truman spends some time gardening before his wife, Meryl Laura Linney, returns from work with a chipper smile on her face Afterwards, Truman visits with his long time friend, Marlon Noah Emmerich, real name Louis Coltrane, where he confides the wish to leave Seahaven, quit his job, and travel to Fiji, echoing a childhood wish to explore despite his teacher's Muriel Moore attempts to dissuade him by informing him that there was nothing left in the world to discover Marlon feigns ignorance and says that he doesn't even know where Fiji isThat evening, Truman sits alone on the beach looking out towards the water He remembers a boating trip he took with his father Brian Delate as a child Blair Slater and requesting that they stay out at sea for just a bit longer Though his father wanted to go back to shore, he complied Shortly after, a strong storm hit and Truman's father was swept overboard and drowned As he comes out of the memory it begins to rain on Trumanand just on Truman When he realizes this, he stands up in shock as the rest of the sky finally opens up in a downpour, prompting him to rush homeHe tells Meryl about his plans to go to Fiji but she dismisses the idea, saying that their financial obligations are much more important When he argues that it could be an adventure she counters by asking if having a baby would be a good adventure She then suggests they go to bed The following morning, as Truman drives to work, he spots a homeless man on the street Looking closely he realizes that the man looks just like his father Before he can get to the man, however, a number of people and strange obstacles spontaneously appear and the homeless man is taken away Later that day, Truman questions his mother Holland Taylor about this over the phone but she refuses to believe any of it and dismisses the idea as wishful thinkingThat night, Truman retreats to the basement of his home where he begins to look through an old trunk filled with his personal mementos He spies a red sweater with a white p"

visit Rachel's sister At the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Samuel inadvertently sees two men brutally murder a third Captain John Book Harrison Ford is the policeman assigned to the caseSamuel witnessed the murder, a slashing, in the restroom and escaped the killers' detection by hiding in a stall Book and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter Brent Jennings, question Samuel He is unable to identify the perpetrator from mug shot photographs or a police lineup, but notices a newspaper clipping at the police station with a picture of highly regarded narcotics officer James McFee Danny Glover and recognizes him as one of the killers Book remembers that McFee was previously responsible for a drug raid where evidence had mysteriously disappeared from the police departmentBook confides his suspicions to his superior officer, Chief Paul Schaeffer Josef Sommer, who advises Book to keep the case secret so they can work out how to move forward with it As Book returns home, he is confronted by McFee in a parking garage and badly wounded in the ensuing gunfight before McFee escapes Since only Schaeffer had been told, Book realizes Schaeffer must have warned McFee and is also

safe arrival in rural Pennsylvania, Book collapses from loss of blood in his vehicle in front of the Lapp farmImpressing upon them that hospitalization will allow the corrupt officers to find him,

payphone that Carter has been killed While still in town, Hochleitner and the other Amish men are harassed by local punks Breaking with the Amish tradition of nonviolence, Book retaliates The fight

warning bell Although Schaeffer briefly forces Book to surrender to him, the loud clanging summons all other Amish within earshot With so many witnesses present it is clear to Schaeffer that he cannot
